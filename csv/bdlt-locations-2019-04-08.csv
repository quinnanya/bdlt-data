"Iskrica","74987","Stara Zagora ","NORTHEASTERN: Sub-Balkan
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the sub-Balkan variety is represented on the website by two villages from the region of Čirpan, Kolju Marinovo (KM), Markovo (M); and one from the region of Stara Zagora, Iskrica (Is). The sub-Balkan dialect group is defined by a complex of features, some of which are shared with Rupic dialects and some of which are specific to the sub-Balkan group. The features illustrated below are characteristic of the sub-Balkan group, dialect, though one of its most salient features (the stressed ending /-a/ in 1st singular present tense forms) is found in only one of the villages represented here.
            The list below summarizes the most important features of the sub-Balkan dialect. It is based on the speech of these three villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. M = Markovo) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. KM1 = Kolju Marinovo 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
Phonology
• The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”, namely /a/ in position before hard syllables and /e/ in position before soft syllables.
            Examples: čàkəj (KM4: 66), čàsə (KM5: 30) // jègne (KM5: 2)
• In most sub-Balkan dialects, the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” appears as /a/ in word-final position and /ɤ/ elsewhere (except in definite forms of feminine nouns in a consonant, where it is always stressed /ɤ/). In texts on this site, this general feature, /a/ in word-final position, occurs only in Iskrica; it is absent Koljo Marinovo and Markovo.      
            Examples from Iskrica: sɤ̀butə (Is1: 49), idɤ̀t (Is1: 36), mumɤ̀tə (Is1: 24), vičirtɤ̀ (Is3: 61) // ležà (Is1: 4), nəsəd’à (Is2: 21) rəkà (Is2: 16) // kɤ̀štə (M4: 40), vudɤ̀ (KM5: 43), kačɤ̀ (KM4: 75).        
• There is full vowel reduction: all unstressed non-high vowels are replaced by the corresponding high vowels. Thus, unstressed /e/, /o/, and /a/ are replaced by /i/, /u/, and /ə/, respectively.
            Examples: vr’èmi (M: 5), pičèm (KM1: 15), pribìrəmi (KM1: 8), ditè (Is1: 15) // d’àdu (M: 7), vulòvi (KM1: 73), pus’ègnə (Is1: 3) // kvəsnìk (KM1: 17), nəsəd’à (Is2: 21).
• Before or after sonorants, /e/ and /i/ are replaced by /’ə/, almost exclusively in post-tonic syllables.
            Examples: mèn’ə (M: 37), vèč’ər (Is1: 75), vr’ətènu (Is1: 69) // užèn’əh (Is1: 1), kùp’əl (M: 10).
• Unstressed /e/ and /i/ are replaced by /u/ after post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: čušmɤ̀ (KM5: 40), žulezà (KM4: 6), žuv’èjət (M: 145)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ before labial consonants in stressed syllables; this occurs only in Iskrica.
            Example: ot’ùvəme (Is1: 71)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: bəkɤ̀rti (KM6: 43), fcèti (M: 40), grədìntə (M: 27), jergènti (M: 89), bàncətə (Is1: 2), sèltu (Is1: 27)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial /e/.
            Examples: jèsenno (KM6: 3), jergènti (M: 89),  jeno-(Is2: 1)
• The consonant /x/ behaves differently depending on its place in the word. In initial position or between vowels, it is lost altogether, in all three villages. In medial position before a consonant it is replaced by /j/ in Markovo and Kolju Marinovo, but lost in Iskrica (frequently with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel). In final position it is either preserved or replaced by /h/  in Koljo Marinovo and Markovo, but replaced by /h/ or /w/ in Iskrica .
            Examples of initial position: òdili (KM3: 35), l’àb (Is3: 25)
            Examples of medial position: dokàrvəə (KM3: 70), ràdvəə (Is1: 9) // isɤ̀jnaa (KM5: 11), ìməjmi (KM5: 42) // zè:me (Is2: 26), prɤ̀ska:mi (Is2: 15), b’àme (Is1: 16)
            Examples of final position:  zər’àzəx (KM5: 11), nəpràvih (M: 39), t’ah (M: 174) // zəbràiw (Is1: 50), zəvɤ̀ršiw (Is3: 16)
• The consonants /l/ and /n/ are softened before soft and post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: gədùl’ki (KM6: 28), mənìn’ki (KM6: 57), mɤl’čɤ̀t (M: 192), nəžil’t’àvə (Is2: 35), t’àn’te (Is2: 3)
• The sequences /dn/ and sometimes also /tn/, and /bn/ are assimilated to /nn/ and /mn/, respectively.
            Examples: plànne (KM5: 44), pannà (M:37), ennà (Is1: 68); s’ènne (I1: 13) // srɤ̀mnəl (M: 130)
• Fricative consonants are replaced by affricates after /r/.
            Examples: vɤ̀rdzənə (KM6: 8), dərdžàə (M:50), dərdžàl (KM5: 30), svɤ̀rdzənu (Is1: 63)
 
Accent
• There is occasional occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: šìlencàtə (KM3: 1), zɤ̀pčetàtə (KM4: 77), àgneàta (Is3: 8)
• The accent is retracted in the plural of feminine nouns, and sometimes also in the singular.
            Examples: dɤ̀ski (KM3: 64), sèstri (M: 72) // rɤ̀kə (KM6: 31) // dəskɤ̀tə (KM3: 71)
• The accent sometimes advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles.
            Examples: stanà (KM5: 9), pannà (M: 37), ustanà (M: 129), kəzàl (M: 17), ustanàli (M: 13), stənà: (Is1: 21)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for polysyllabic masculine nouns is /-e/, though /i/ appears as well.
            Examples: kəràre (KM3: 25), ərmàne (KM2: 70); čekɤ̀mi (KM2: 61), krèmeni (KM3: 57)
• The ending of feminine nouns when stress is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely/ɤ/, except in the non-definite form in Iskrica.
            Examples: rikɤ̀tə (KM5: 63), vujnɤ̀tɤ̥ (M: 13), mumɤ̀tə (Is1: 24) // veselbà (Is1: 63)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. It was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns.
• There are different forms of the personal pronouns, including differences between the three villages. Examples:
            3rd singular accusative feminine short form: gə in Markovo and Iskrica // jə in Koljo Marinovo
           Examples: žə jə nəmùšiš (KM2: 16), up’èkələ gə (Is1: 2) // nìj gə pràimi (M: 4) 
            3rd plural nominative: tìj (KM4: 8, M: 10), tìjə (KM3: 43), t’èe (Is1: 9)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dàdəh (M: 36), prudàdəjmi (M: 40), dòjdah (Is1: 1)
• The future particle is že.
            Examples: že izl’èzim (M: 89), že tùriš (KM2: 9),  že dòət (Is3: 42)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111), up’èkələ (Is1: 2)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
The dialect of Iskrica, which is very close to the Rupic area, has some additional features considered predominantly Rupic:
• Under stress he historical Slavic vowel “jat” frequently appears as /’a/ or /ɛ/ before a soft consonant or front vowel.
            Examples: t’àn’te (Is2: 29), n’àštu (Is3: 17), gul’ɛ̀mi (Is 2: 1) // b’èše (Is1: 1)
• The nominative pronoun for 1st person singular is /ja/.
            Example: jà sɤzdàdəw (Is1: 17)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
            Examples: nər’àdəme  (Is2: 40), zəfàt’ət  (Is1: 59)

The complex dialectal variation of Bulgarian is best described within three major categories; the detailed description below follows this outline.
       The rubric Phonology describes the sound system of a dialect. Because the current forms (""reflexes"") of historical Slavic vowels divide the region so systematically, they are used as cover symbols for current lexical distribution of these sounds.
       The rubric Accent notes systematic differences in accent placement from the standard language; these are usually associated with grammatically-defined groups.
       The rubric Morphology describes features of nouns, pronouns and verbs that differ from the standard language in particularly noteworthy ways.

"Nasalevci","22082","Trŭn","TRANSITIONAL: Trŭn
            The dialect of Trŭn is represented on the website by one village, Nasalevci. It is part, together with the Belogradčik dialects, of the larger group which has been called “transitional dialects”, also known as “border dialects”, “u-dialects” or “ č-dž dialects”. The first two names derive from the fact that all these dialects are located close to the border with Serbia, and share many traits with the neighboring far eastern Serbian dialects, while the second two names refer to major dialectal traits shared with these neighboring Serbian dialects.
            Whichever name is used for this larger dialect group, it is striking that there is so little internal variation, especially given the fact that speakers in the northern portion of the area (the Belogradčik dialect group, represented on this site by Repljana, Stakevci and Vŭrbovo) and the speakers in the southern portion (represented here by the Trŭn dialect group and the village of Nasalevci) are rarely in contact with one another due to both to considerable physical distance and the fact of a mountain range separating them. Because the differences that do exist are noteworthy, the two groups are here described separately.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Trŭn dialect group. It is based on the speech of the Nasalevci dialect, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. N1 = Nasalevci 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: vrèla (N1: 87), lèp (N1: 11)
• The historical sequence “ja”  (including the sequence “post-alveolar + a”) is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples: čàšku (N1: 38), jàgništa (N2: 117) // čèkam (N1: 71), edù (N1: 46)
• The historical Slavic “back nasal” always appears as /u/.
            Examples: sùbotu (N1: 6), nàruku (N1: 204)
• The historical Slavic “front jer” appears as /ɤ/.
            Example: kvasɤ̀c (N2: 76) 
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged, except that syllabic /ḷ/ is replaced by /u/ after bilabial consonants.
            Examples: cṛ̀kvu (N1: 7), gṛbìnu (N1: 45), vḷ̀na (N1: 199) // pùno (N2: 71), muzè (N2: 119)
• The Proto-Slavic sequences /*tj/ and /*dj/ appear as /č/ and /dž/, respectively.
            Examples: nòčem (N1: 85), ridžà (N2: 25)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cṛ/.
            Example: cṛnà (N2: 21)
• Early South Slavic “epenthetic /l/” is not lost, as it is in most other Bulgarian dialects.
            Examples: zeml’àno (N2: 141), spràvl’aju (N1: 12)
• The consonant /x/ is lost in most positions.
            Examples: òro (N1: 49), ràni (N1: 103)
• Before a vowel, the sequence /jk/ is replaced by /k’/.
            Examples: màk’a (N1: 102), devòk’a (N1: 109)
• The consonant /f/ is replaced by /v/.
            Examples: vamìlijata (N1: 29), kṛ̀v (N1: 168)
     It does not appear even as an voiceless allophone of /v/.
            Example: òvce (N1: 11)
• Voiced obstruents may appear word-finally.
            Example: dɤ̀lɤg (N1: 216)
• Soft consonants occur rarely, and never in masculine definite forms or in verbal endings (contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects).
            Examples: prijàtelɤ (N1: 90), kànu (N2: 71)
     In fact, only /k/, /g/, /l/, and /n/ have soft correlates at all.
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ in word-initial position, and to /vn/ in other positions
            Examples: mlògo (N2: 56) // stòvni (N1: 58)
 
Accent
• The accent frequently occurs on the ending in some polysyllabic masculine nouns.
            Examples: koledarì (N2: 72), rɤkavè (N1: 224)
• In some adjectives the stress is on the ending.
            Examples: golò (N1: 175), debelò (N2: 65)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in L-participles, regardless of whether there is a syllabic prefix or not.
            Examples: oratìla (N2: 16), oženìl (N1:82)
    The same advancement occurs in aorist forms, except that the accent is retracted to the initial syllable (or a verbal prefix) in 2nd and 3rd singular forms. Examples:
            1st singular aorist   kazà (N1: 54)
            3rd singular aorist   iznàpisa (N2: 10)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2nd conjugation verbs.
            Examples: dàri (N1: 45), obikòli (N2: 168)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative forms.
            Examples: pòpari (N1: 93), ìdi (N1: 180)
 
Morphology
• One of the most interesting traits of the Trŭn dialect is the existence of a tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. Such a distinction is found in the Rhodope dialects as well, where it encompasses a much larger area. There is a formal difference between the two regions, in that the “proximal” form is marked in Trǔn dialects by the formant /-v-/, whereas it is marked by the formant /-s-/ in Rhodope dialects. (In both regions the “medial” [= neutral] form is marked by /-t-/ and the “distal” form by /-n-/.)
     Published sources on the Trŭn dialect assert that both proximal and distal articles occur regularly. Our impression is that they occur much less frequently in Trŭn than in the Rhodopes: in roughly three hours of recording from Nasalevci, only two proximal forms were heard, and no distal forms. Although strictly speaking there is no reason to assert that the existence of proximal articles in a dialect also implies existence of the distal ones, it is generally assumed that this is the case.
            Examples: momèvo (N2: 10), malòvo (N1: 213)
• Although there are no examples of such three-way deixis in demonstrative pronouns (in which speakers use forms with /-ov-/ to mark the idea of proximity, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distal” forms, marked with /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively), it may be assumed that they exist, given the evidence of adverbial forms with the marker /-ov-/.
            Examples:  ovakà (N1: 46), ve (N1: 151)
• The forms of personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà (N1: 59)
            3rd singular nominative òn (N1: 41), onà (N2: 21), onò (N1: 124)
            3rd singular dative feminine nèvu (N1: 58)
            3rd singular dative feminine short form vi (N1: 58);
            3rd plural nominative onì [form not attested in these texts]
• The plural ending of masculine nouns is either /-e/ or /-i/. This is not surprising, since the Bulgarian Dialect Atlas positions Nasalevci right on the isogloss dividing these two traits.
            Examples: koledarì (N2: 72), rɤkavè (N1: 224)
• The plural ending of all feminine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: svìrke (N1: 48), tantèle (N1: 224), dùme (N2, 24)
• Non-nominative forms of feminine nouns, feminine singular adjectives, and masculine nouns signifying animate beings, are in regular use.
            Examples: svàdbu (1: 42), bànicu (1: 43), (masculine animate nouns not represented in these texts)
        These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, such nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case (“animate accusative” in the instance of the masculine nouns) and was used for all other meanings
• A particularly interesting corollary of the above is the fact that the definite article attached to these forms also shows inherited cases endings (/-tu/ for feminine and /-toga/ for animate masculine). 
            Example: baštùtu (N1: 124), drugòtoga (1: 39)
• Plural forms of adjectives and demonstratives distinguish all three genders, with masculine marked by /-i/, feminine by /-e/ and neuter by /-a/. 
            Examples: rìdži mustàci (N2: 40); tèje dùme (N2: 14); dṛvà dɤ̀lga (N2: 58)
• The ending in all 1st person singular present tense forms is /-m/, except in the modal verb ‘can’, which has the ending /-u/.
            Examples: kazùjem (N1, 69), kàžem (N1: 224) // mògu (N1: 69)
• The ending in all 1st person plural present tense forms is /-mo/.
            Examples: pràimo (N2: 52), tràžimo (N2: 179)
• The ending in all 3rd person plural present tense is /-u/.
            Examples: otìdu (N1: 38), kànu (N1: 39), zbìraju (N1: 9)
• The ending for 2nd person plural aorist tense is /-ste/.
            Example: obṛkàste (N2: 83)
• There are two different future particles: ču for 1st person singular and če for all other persons.
            Examples: jà ču ga nòčem popàrim (N1: 85); če dòjdemo (N1: 42)
• Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example: jèden’e (N1: 12)

"Tihomir","21241","Krumovgrad","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Tihomir
               The village of Tihomir is located in the eastern Rhodopes, in the southernmost part of the Krumovgrad area. Little if anything was known about its dialect before Stajko Kabasanov published his monograph description (Kabasanov 1963). Because of its highly archaic features, it has subsequently attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. 
               Kabasanov’s view is that the dialect is unique and cannot be grouped with those of neighboring dialects into a single system, but that it nevertheless does share a number of phonetic and lexical features with these neighboring villages (Kabasanov 1963: 3). The authors of the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/) view the group this way, calling it the Tihomir dialect. We describe here together the two villages on the website from this group, that of Tihomir itself (T) and that of Šumnatica (Š). At the same time we recognize the uniqueness of the Tihomir dialect by listing features specific to it alone separately (at the end of the Phonology and Morphology sections, respectively).
            The list below summarizes the salient features representing both Tihomir and the wider Tihomir group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. T1 = Tihomir 1, Š2 = Šumnatica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” usually appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  but sometimes also as /e/.
               Examples: l’ɛ̀p  (T1: 46), bɛ̀ga  (T1: 72), gr’ɛ̀e  (Š1: 45), bɛ̀lu  (Š3: 226), cɛ̀lu  (Š3: 36) // l’èbate  (T2: 44)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”  appear in stressed syllables as /ɛ/  in Tihomir and as /a/  in Šumnatica.
               Examples: č’ɛkə  (T1: 83), jɛ̀sla  (T3: 12) // jàdene  (Š3: 106), č’àkəš  (Š3: 132)
•  As in other Rhodope dialects, there is a merger of the four classic historical Slavic vowels (both “jers” and both nasals), with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones (Miletič 1912: 29). Here, however, the vowel that results is different in the two dialects: it is /ɔ/  in Tihomir, but /a/  in Šumnatica. On occasion, front “jer” can appear as /e/.
               Examples for back “jer”:  dɔ̀ska  (T3: 75), isɔ̀hne  (T2: 92) // svetàt  (Š1: 35)
               Examples for back nasal: gɔ̀bi  (T3: 71), krɔ̀pa  (T1: 178) // kàštata  (Š3: 109)
               Examples for front “jer”:  ap’ɔ̀neš  (T1: 246),  tènka  (T21: 189) // l’àsnu  (Š3: 150), zèmeš (Š3: 216) 
               Examples for front nasal: pr’ɔ̀dena  (T1: 190), zat’ɔgneme  (T1: 179) // gl‘àdəj (Š3: 161)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appears as /ɔr/  and /ɔl/  in Tihomir, and as /ar/  and /al/  in Šumnatica.
               Examples: vɔ̀rtneš  (T1: 242), pɔ̀rsten’e  (T1: 24), napɔ̀lni  (T1: 246), vɔ̀lnata  (T1: 245) // pàrskani  (Š3: 46), vàlnətə  (Š3: 218)
• The consonant /x/  is either replaced by /h/,  or lost altogether, without regard to position in the word.  
               Examples: hurkəi  (T1: 202), hàrkmətə  (Š3: 82), drabɛ̀han  (T2: 182), səberàhə  (Š2: 29) // òrə  (Š1: 23), lɛ̀p  (T1: 46), klad’èmen  (T2: 113), izb’agəə  (Š2: 30)
• The sequence /dn/  is either assimilated to /nn/,  or simplified to /n/.
               Examples: spànne  (T1: 171), s’enneš  (Š3: 111) // pònicɔ  (T2: 11)
• The sequence /bn/  is assimilated to /mn/.
               Example: drèmničku  (Š2: 28) [no examples in attested in Tihomir texts]
 
PHONOLOGICAL FEATURES SPECIFIC TO TIHOMIR
• Whereas in nearly all other Bulgarian dialects, the historical Slavic vowel “jery”  (Cyrillic ы) merged with /i/,  in Tihomir it retained its original lexical distribution, and appears as a high front unrounded vowel with a centralized on-glide, /əi/.  In unstressed syllables it sometimes appears as /ɤ/. 
               Examples: aməìeme  (T2: 35), bəìva  (T2: 159), drùgɤkvəi  (T1: 141), kòrəi  (T2: 60) // dùpkɤ  (T3: 75)
• Like many (but not all) dialects spoken by Bulgarian Muslims, Tihomir is characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by /a/. What is specific to Tihomir is that this happens not just in pretonic syllables but in all unstressed syllables.
               Examples: apìnaš  (T1: 217), kòpeleta  (T1: 72), mnòga  (T1: 179)
• In Tihomir the vowel /e/  is replaced by /o/  in stressed syllables after postalveolar consonants.
               Examples: jòrš  (T3: 61), varšòme  (T3: 50), ž’òna  (T1: 78)
• The Tihomir dialect has long consonants; they appear in the plural forms of masculine nouns and in verbal nouns.
               Examples: kamiòn:e  (T1: 41), sakùl’:e  (T2: 212), jàden:e  (T3: 57)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: dɔ̀ska  (T3: 75), ž’òna  (T1: 78), žèna  (Š1: 15) // k’ɛsta (T2: 57), dɔ̀rvo  (T3: 39), t’èle  (Š3: 175)
• The accent is retracted to the first syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: zàpitam  (Š1: 44), klàdəm  (T2: 136)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: vìdi  (Š3: 261), zàkərpi  (Š3: 161)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: pɔ̀rsten’e  (T1: 24), gr’èbene  (T1: 99), džuràpe  (Š3: 209), burkàne  (Š3: 12)
• Like other Rhodope dialects, these too have the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: ajlɔ̀kət  (T1: 47), matavìlkanɔ  (T1: 264), svetàt  (Š1: 45), sičkunu  (Š3: 211)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (or /-so/,  /-no/).
            Examples: stàn:eto  (T1: 141), čaìreto  (T2: 16)// [no examples of proximal or distal articles attested in the texts]
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
            Examples: sɛ̀e  (T1: 201), tòo  (T2: 215), nvà  (T3: 2), svà  (Š1: 45), tàa  (Š1: 15), nvà  (Š3: 236)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function. In addition, the form nèkva  is used in place of  nèšto ‘something’.
               Examples: n’akəkvi izb’agəə  (Š2: 30), pòsle adème nèkva  (T1: 34)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Examples: kənà (Š3: 156), kanà (T1: 1)
• The 1st person singular present tense ending for all verbs is /-m/.
               Examples: kàžəm  (T1: 1), tɔ̀čem  (T1: 102), pràm  (Š3: 93)
• Plural past tense endings add a final consonant /n/.
               Examples: bèən  (Š2: 37), zəkrìən  (Š4: 8), drabɛ̀han  (T2: 182), klad’èmen  (T2: 113)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Example: dàdəme (Š1: 93)
ª The present stem is used in the aorist form of some verbs.
               Example: səberàhə  (Š2: 29)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
               Examples: kàžuvame  (T1: 219), ràdɤše  (T1: 38), fàte  (Š3: 166)
 
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES SPECIFIC TO TIHOMIR
• Non-nominative forms of feminine nouns are in regular use. The ending is usually the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/,  and sometimes /o/  or /ɯ/ (a high, back rounded vowel similar to Turkish /ı/).
            Examples: matavìlkɔ  (T1: 227), pònicɔ  (T2: 11) // hùrko  (T1: 201), aràpkɯ (T1: 39)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, such nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven): the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case (whose ending was the back nasal vowel) and was used for all other meanings.
• The Tihomir dialect is unique in that it preserves non-nominative forms for all masculine nouns (whereas the few other dialects which preserve non-nominative forms only do so for masculine nouns signifying an animate being). The ending for these forms is -/ɤ/  or /-a/. 
               Examples: klìnɤ  (T1: 31) tòka  (T1: 140)
   The definite non-nominative form of masculine nouns ends in /-ate/.
               Examples:  stanàte  (T1: 101), l’èbat’e  (T2: 40)
• The Tihomir dialect uses the relative pronoun “ažit”.
               Examples: ažìt ìma d’uvène  (T2: 182), ažòto znàm  (T1: 1)

"Gorna Krušica","20030","Sandanski","SOUTHWESTERN: Petrič
            Within the larger region of Southwestern Bulgarian dialects, the southernmost section is represented on this site by the Petrič group, with the two villages of Gorna Krušica (GK) and Skrŭt (S). Many authors, including those of the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/), do not distinguish the Petrič group from the Blagoevgrad dialect group. However, because these two villages are so far from Blagoevgrad, and because there is a precedent for labeling the Petrič group as separate (Stojkov 1993: 159 – though even he notes that it is “very similar” to the Blagoevgrad dialect), the Petrič dialect is viewed here as a separate group. 
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Petrič dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. GK1 = Gorna Krušica 1, S2 = Skrŭt 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology:
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” usually appears as /e/ except after the consonant /c/ where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: namèsto (GK1: 22), nèkoj (GK1: 97), mlèko (1: 23) // cadìlka (GK2: 24), càl (S2: 79)
    Since this dialect is located near the major “jat isogloss” it is not surprising to find sporadic forms with /’a/ for “jat”.
            Example: gol’àmi (S2: 108)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” appears as /a/.
            Examples: stàpa (GK2: 6), oràt (GK2: 21), poràčva (S1: 22), vàgle (S3: 78)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back jer” appears as /a/ or /o/ in root morphemes, and as /o/ in affixes and in the definite article.
            Examples: làžeš (S1: 43), navònka (S1: 200) // sobèremè (GK1: 7), takòf (GK1: 83),         pisòk (S1: 162) // balkàno (GK 3:50), lèbo (S1: 28)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears as /e/.
            Examples: tèmnoto (GK3: 23), ošèl (S1: 38)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /r/ appears as /rɤ/, and early South Slavic syllabic /l/ appears as /ɤ/.
            Examples: vrɤtìme (GK1: 22), krɤ̀pi (GK1: 38), brɤ̀kat (S2: 22), drɤ̀veni (S2: 32) // vɤ̀nata (GK3: 37)
• The consonant /x/ is preserved word-finally; elsewhere it is lost.
            Examples: udarìx (GK1: 156), nìx (GK2: 31), odìh (S1: 53) // òdi (GK1: 148), lèbo (S1: 28), òro (S1: 89)
• The behavior of /x/ in past tense verbal endings before a consonant is different in the two villages. In Skrŭt it disappears or is replaced by /j/, while in Gorna Krušica it is sometimes preserved. More frequently it disappears, having caused lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: odìme (S2: 11), edèjme (S3: 13), pòstejme (S3: 28) // sčepkàxme (GK3: 35), vìka:me (GK1: 20), kàzva:me (GK1: 29)
     There appears in both villages to be a correlation between verbal tense and behavior of /x/: forms in which it is lost are those of the aorist, while those in which it is replaced by /j/ or lengthening are those of the imperfect. There is too little data to make a categorical claim, however.
• Palatal consonants may appear in word final position.
            Examples: dèn’ (S2: 154), ògin’ (S3: 78)
• There may be anticipation of softness with the softness remaining on the consonant.
            Example: tigàjn’ (S3: 22)
• Soft /t’/ is replaced by soft /k’/.
            Examples: svàk’ata (GK1: 135), pàk’o (S3: 85)
• The sequence /vn/ is assimilated to /mn/.
            Example: glamnìte (S2: 25)
• In Skrŭt the consonant /j/ is lost when it occurs between two vowels.
            Examples: mòa (S2: 16), nèa (S2: 151), pèat (S2: 85)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: ùlicìte (GK1: 5), tàpanèto (S2: 32), svàbvitè le (GK1: 2)
• The accent is retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: òfce (GK2: 22), kòzi (GK2: 22), dèca (GK1: 44), òro (S1: 89), mèso (S2: 48)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in many verbs from the 2nd conjugation.
            Examples: ròdi (GK2: 38), issùšime (GK: 25), gòdat (S2: 7), svàri (S3: 45)
• The accent is retracted to initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: pèča (GK2: 19), ìzvadàm (GK2: 21)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative forms.
            Examples: òdi (GK1: 148), dròbi (S3: 40)
•The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles, including in the presence of a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: odìl (S1: 7), pobegnàl (S1: 62), slagàli (GK1: 4)
 
Morphology
• The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jàs (GK1: 86, S1: 18),
            3rd singular nominative masculine òn (S1: 32)
            3rd singular nominative feminine onà (GK1: 137)
            3rd singular nominative neuter onò (GK1: 137)
            1st plural nominative nìeka (GK1: 50)
            3rd plural nominative  onì (GK 1:134)
            3rd plural accusative nìx (GK2: 31, S1: 77)
            3rd plural accusative short form i (S2:150)
• The accent placement in third person nominative pronouns differs between the two villages.
            Examples: onà (GK1: 137), onì (GK1: 132) // òna (S1: 12), òni (S1: 87)
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/ or /-je/.
            Examples: kazàne (GK1: 12), peškìrje (GK1: 7), ribàre (S1: 65)
• The masculine singular definite article is /-o/.
            Examples: svèkaro (GK1: 85), ògino (S1: 25)
• The masculine plural article is /-to/.
            Examples: stanovèto (GK1: 36), tapanàreto (S2: 42)
• The ending in 1st person singular present tense for verbs of 1st and 2d conjugation is /-a/ for all unprefixed verbs. For prefixed verbs it is also /-a/ in S, but it is /-am/ in GK.
            Examples: kàža (S1: 1), ìda (S1: 18), mèsa (GK2: 2), pèča (GK2: 19) // navàl’a (S1: 55), òdnesàm (GK2: 25), ìstkaam (GK3: 25)
• Verbs of the 2nd conjugation have hard consonants preceding the endings of 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense forms.  
            Examples: òženàm (GK2: 26), kànat (S2: 41)
 • The ending in 1st person plural present tense for verbs of 1st and 2d conjugation is /-me/, though sometimes also /-m/.
            Examples: tkàeme (GK1: 5), sèdneme (GK1: 10), òdime (S1: 18) // dòim (S3: 14), izlèzem (S3: 20)
• The future particle is ke or ki.
            Examples: ke fànete (GK1: 129), ki dòe (S1: 9)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-n/.
            Example: sèjan (S3: 60)
• The present stem is used in aorist forms, L-participles, and passive participles in some verb classes.
            Examples: pokažàx (GK3: 10), mažàli (GK1: 97), zanìženi (S1: 37), kažàli (S1: 87)
• Intransitive verbs can be used as transitive.
            Example: ki go zàspiš (S1: 20)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
• In Skrŭt there is a theme vowel generalization for 1st and 2nd conjugation verbs, to /-i-/ in 2nd singular forms and /-e-/ in 3rd singular forms.
            Examples: srètniš (S1: 141) // gàle (S1: 38), pròste (S1: 93)
• In Gorna Krušica the morpheme /-še-/ is incorporated into all plural forms of the imperfect tense.
            Example: zìmašèa (GK3: 32)

"Vladimirovo","19450","Vidin","NORTHWESTERN: Vidin - Lom
 
            Within the larger region of Northwest Bulgarian dialects, the Vidin-Lom dialect group is a recognized category. On this website, the Vidin-Lom group is represented by three villages: Arčar (A), Gradec (G), and Vladimirovo (V). Maxim Mladenov (1993: 60-61) made a subsequent division within this group, citing the form of the future particle as the isogloss dividing them. He called only the western group (with the future particle če) by the name Vidin-Lom, and termed the eastern group (with the future particle šeor ša) the Cibrica-Ogosta group. According to this division then, Arčar and Gradec belong to the Vidin-Lom group, while Vladimirovo belongs to the Cibrica-Ogosta group.
            Dialect speech from the Vidin-Lom dialect group (in either the narrower or the broader interpretation) is very similar to the colloquial register of the capital city of Sofia – that register associated with less educated Sofia residents. It is so close, in fact, that migrants to Sofia from the Vidin-Lom region find it so easy to blend in linguistically to their new habitat that they usually fail to notice what still distinguishes their speech. One such feature is the advancement of accent to the theme vowel in the aorist form of verbs. The difference is that Sofia speech advances the accent in all verb classes, while the Vidim-Lom dialect advances it only in verbs with no prefix (or with a non-syllabic prefix).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Vidin-Lom dialect group. It is based on the speech of the three villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. While not all these features can be found in urban speech with the Vidin-Lom region, few can be totally excluded, at least as variables.
 
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. A1 = Arčar 1, A2 = Arčar 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology.
The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: izbèga (A1: 29), pèsɤk (A1: 38), umrèla (G1: 8)
Etymological “ja” is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples: jàla (G 1:43), jàjca(V2: 111) // čèkaj (A1: 6), edèš (G1: 70)
Unstressed /o/ is occasionally replaced by /a/.
            Example: vadìci (G1: 47), tavà (G1: 33)
There are frequent vowel assimilations.
            Examples: bàam (G1: 7), koto (G1: 57), mòo (V1,104), ko o čùš (V2: 75)
                   Note: the form tavà (GI: 33) may be a result of this as well.
The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged:
            Examples: gṛkl’àna (G1: 53), tṛbì (A1: 4), sḷ̀nčička (G1: 50);
The consonant /x/ is lost intervocalically. After a front vowel it may go to /j/.
            Examples: otidème (A1: 7), meùre (G1: 53); mèj (V2: 95).
Epenthetic /l/ is preserved in the word for “earth”.
            Example: zeml’àta (G2: 25);
Soft consonants are relatively rare. Only /k/,/g/,/l/,and /n/ have soft correlates, but they are not used in masculine definite forms and verbal endings.
            Example: žènat (V2: 18)
Alveolar consonants become postalveolar before palatals.
            Example: bàšn’a (G1: 3)
Soft /t’/and /d’/are replaced by /k’/and /g’/.
            Examples: gòsk’e (V1: 43), gròzg’e (V1: 72).
 
Accent
The accent is retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns
            Examples: vòda (V2: 42), rɤ̀ce (G1: 112), ùsta (G1: 35), dṛ̀va (A1: 29), jàjca (V2: 111)
      This is not completely consistent, however.
            Examples: rekà (G2: 7), detè (G2: 13)
The accent shifts to the end in some adjectives.
            Example: mutà (G1: 33)
The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles.
            Examples: stignà (A1: 50), padnàle (A1: 4)
    This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: isìpa (A1: 49), obèsila (G1: 18)
The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2d conjugation verbs.
            Examples: svàri( A2: 29), ròdim (G1: 75)
 
Morphology
The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative  jà (G1: 7)
            3rd singular nominative  òn (A1: 12), onà (G1: 18, onò (A1: 36)
            3rd plural nominative onì (G2: 6)
            3rd plural accusative  n’ì (A1: 13)
            3rd plural dative short form ngi (V1: 102), gim (A1: 2)
The plural of masculine (and occasionally feminine) nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: masculine meùre (G1: 53), feminine kèle (G1: 49)
The masculine singular definite article in nouns is /-ɤ/ if stressed and /-a/ (or /-ɤ/) if not.
            Examples: gṛdɤ̀ (G1: 51), džàma (G1: 51)
    In adjectives the articles is /-ea/, found most consistently in Gradec.
            Example: màlkea (G2: 2)
     (Note: the lowering of /i/ to /e/ seems restricted to these forms, but is also recorded in the verb napràvea (G1: 65).
The ending in all 1st person singular present tense forms is /-m/.
            Example: mèrim (A1: 6)
The ending in all 1st person plural present tense forms is /-me/.
            Example: donesème (A2: 25).
The future particle is either če or še/ša.
            Examples: če se svàri (A2: 29) // še mi kùpite (G1: 23)
In western regions the imperfect tense incorporates the morpheme /-še-/ in all forms.
            Example: ìmašeme (A2: 38)
The plural ending for the L-participle is /-e/.
            Example: istṛ̀pnale (G1 126)
Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example:kòpan’e (V1: 67).
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY on the dialect of Vladimirovo, from the Cibrica-Ogosta group.
In addition to the future particle, mentioned above, this dialect is further distinguished by:
Compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel after the loss of /x/.
            Example:  òde:me (V2: 20)
The replacement of soft /l’/ by /j/.
            Example: trevojàci (V2: 121)
Inconsistent use of the count plural.
            Examples trì pràznici (V1: 104), but also trì dèna (V2: 9).

"Petrov Dol","19449","","NORTHEASTERN: MOESIAN: Greben (Garvan, Srebŭna), Sŭrt (Petrov Dol), Drjanovec (Kapan)
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. According to Miletič’s definition, the Moesian group extends to the river Jantra in the west, and in the past even as far west as the “jat”-boundary, the basic division line between western and eastern macro-dialects (Miletich 1903). There are several sub-dialects within the Moesian group that form relatively small islands, but most of the territory is unspecified, simply called Moesian (see the IBL dialect map at http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/). Although there is no single unifying feature, but rather characteristic Moesian traits that overlap from region to region but do not cover the whole area, the speech of the area is immediately recognizable as Moesian.
            Three of the four recognizable islands within Moesian are represented on this website: the two villages Garvan (G) and Srebŭrna (S) represent the Greben variety; the village Petrov Dol (PD) represents the Sŭrt variety, and the village Drjanovec (D) represents the Kapan variety. The list below summarizes the salient features of these Moesian sub-varieties. It is based on the speech of these four villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. S1 = Srebŭrna 1, PD2 = Petrov Dol 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ in position before hard syllables. There is regional difference in its behavior before soft syllables: it is /’ɛ/ in Sŭrt (PD), and /’e/ elsewhere.
            Examples: m’àstu (PD1: 99), kul’àntȕ (D1: 25), l’àtu (G2: 24), ml’aku (S2: 30) // nid’èl’e (S1: 104), b’èli (G1: 48), gul’èmi (D1: 63) // nɤm’ɛ̀ri (PD1: 33)
    The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: venčàvə (G1: 59), isušàvəš (S2: 55) // čeršèvi (S1: 107), venč’èni (G1: 70) // mɤlčàna (PD2: 18), vɤrš’ɛ̀čki (PD3: 115)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed root syllables as /ɤ/ (see under Morphology for the particular behavior of “back jer” in the masculine singular definite article).
            Examples of back jer: tɤ̀kɤn (D1: 17), dɤ̀ski (G1: 123), mɤ̀kniš (PD3: 49)
            Examples of back nasal: mɤ̀kɤtɤ (D2: 69), pɤ̀t’ (G2: 17, PD1: 37), bɤ̀di (S1: 55)
     Miletič considered the “strongly dark” pronunciation of this vowel, which became known as “velar ъ”, to be one of the principal features of Moesian dialects. This feature is very rare today. Extensive fieldwork underlying the Bulgarian Dialect Atlas (undertaken in the 1950s) found it in only one location, Petrov Dol. In texts recorded for BDLT, it exists as the optional allophonic raising of /ɤ/ to /ɯ/.
            Examples: kɯ̀šti (PD2: 75); rəskɤ̀səli (PD1: 91)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears in stressed root syllables as either /e/ or /ɤ/, with only the latter occurring before nasal consonants.
            Examples: dèn’ (D1; 60), l’èku (S2: 39), ž’ènim (PD: 86) // pɤ̀sro (G1: 48), zɤ̀mniš (D2: 52), zɤ̀mət (S1: 56)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (thus, there is no “mixing of the nasals”).
            Examples: gl’èdə (D2: 22), zèt’u (S1: 94), šètə (D1: 42), ž’ètvəta (PD: 7)
• All unstressed non-high vowels are replaced by the corresponding high vowels. Thus, unstressed /e/, /o/, and /a/ are replaced by /i/, /u/, and /ɤ/, respectively. In Bulgarian dialectology this is termed “full vowel reduction”.
            Examples: b’èši (D1: 8), vrèmi (G1: 21) usimnàjsi (D1: 44) //  udòlu (G1: 21), udr’èž’im (PD3: 7) // glɤvɤ̀tɤ (D2: 11), klɤnn’ì (PD3: 33)
     In posttonic syllables and especially before sonorants, unstressed /e/ is pronounced as /’ə/ or /’ɤ/.
            Examples: v’èč’ər (D2: 21) bosìl’ək (S1: 93), v’ès’ɤlu (D1: 8), tòpč’ənca (PD2: 34)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. This is one of the highly distinctive markers of Moesian speech.
            Examples: ž’uwòt (D1: 74) ut’ùəm (PD1: 97), ž’uv’ɛ̀i (PD1: 20), b’ùwa (S1: 105), zəl’ùwəm (S1: 120)
• Word-initial stressed /o/ is replaced by /wo/.
            Examples: wòc’əm (D1: 23), wòs’əm (G1: 189)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost. Continuants in position before such a lost vowel are frequently lengthened; this process, called here “consonant-vowel fusion” here, is especially common after sonorants.
            Examples: čètri (D1: 11), žìttu (PD3: 147), sìttu (G1: 179) // məgàr:tȁ (D2: 39), màs:tȅ (G1: 116), dàr:tu (S1: 106)
• The consonant /x/ is lost in word-initial position; in other positions of the word it is replaced by /w/, /v/, or /f/. This is another of the highly distinctive markers of Moesian speech.
            Examples: òd’ɤ (D1: 40), òrtə (S2: 155) // t’aw (G1: 96), màwnɤ (D2: 46), b’àw (D1: 23), zèw (S2: 119) // òrevi (S2: 8), tùrivə (D2: 65), tɤ̀rsiva (G1: 168), slàgəvmi (PD2: 45) // nəm’èr’uf (S1: 34), kòžufč’etu (G1: 7).
            Exception:  snɤɤ̀ (D2: 33)
• The consonant /f/ is replaced by /v/ or /w/. Before the vowel /u/ it sometimes shifts to the bilabial voiceless fricative  /ф/.
            Examples: čəršèvi (S1: 107) // suwrɤ̀tə (S1: 97) // фùsti (G1: 213)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before rounded vowels, and usually replaced by /w/ in other positions (/w/ can also appear before rounded vowels, thought this is more rare).
            Examples: pruòdijmi (D2: 41), tòjtə (D1: 53), otòr:no (G2: 10), utòrenə (PD1: 99) // òwču (D1: 61), nìwɤtɤ (D2: 22), wrɤ̀štət (G1: 157), wèče (PD1: 54) // ž’uwòt (D1: 74)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: dèn’ (D1: 60), p’èt’ (D1: 65), pɤ̀t’ (G2: 17), d’èsit’ (PD2: 22)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: innà (D1: 59), plànne (G1: 145), klɤnn’ì (PD3: 33)
• The vowel /i/ is sometimes inserted before an initial consonant cluster.
            Examples: ismɤ̀kvə (G1: 68), iskɤ̀swə (S2: 51)
• There is a regional difference in the behavior of the sequence /str/: it is replaced by /sr/ in Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D) varieties but not in Sŭrt (PD).
            Examples: srùvɤ (D1: 124), sràf (G2: 29), srigɤ̀t (S2: 2) // strɤ̀ka (PD 2: 24)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: dɤ̀ski (G1: 123), sèstri (S1: 76), glàvi (S2: 130)
• There is frequent occurence of a secondary stress on the plural definite article; this also occurs, though less frequently, on feminine and neuter singular articles.
            Examples: màjki̥t’ȅ (D2: 16), pìtkit’ȅ (PD2: 34), drùgit’ȅ (G1: 173) // kul’àntȕ (D1: 25), rìz:tȁ (G1: 173)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for polysyllabic nouns is /-e/, though /i/ appears as well.
            Examples: əjdučòre (G2: 28), misàl’e (PD2: 89), rəkòe (PD3: 48), kumšìe (D2: 20) // məsùri (S2: 124), svədbàri (S1: 67)
• There is regional difference with respect to the ending of feminine nouns when stressed. In Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D), it is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/, whereas in Sǔrt (PD), it is /a/.
            Examples: glɤvɤ̀tə (D2: 11), rɤkɤ̀ (G1: 69), strənɤ̀ (S2: 143)// guràta (PD1: 24), vudà (PD2: 19)
               These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In the Greben and Kapan groups, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns, while in the Sŭrt group it was the old nominative case in /a/  which continued as their single form.  
• There is regional difference in the form of the definite article for masculine singular nouns.  In Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D), it is /-o/ (when unstressed, /-u/), but in Sǔrt (PD) it is /-ɤ/.
            Examples: məžò (G1: 5), zèt’u (S1: 67), dulàpu (D1: 17), tòju (G1: 60) // pragɤ̀ (PD1: 31), zbòrɤ (PD2: 123), trètijɤ (PD1: 71)
• Some indefinite adjectives appear in the long form.
            Examples: drùgij (D1: 49), nàšij (D1: 71), šèstij (PD2: 5)
• Personal pronouns are used as demonstrative.
            Examples: n’ègu dèn’ (D1: 60), nègu bòp (S2: 181), t’àw xòra (D1: 20), tè misàl’e (PD: 89)
• There is regional difference in the form of the back nasal in 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense endings of the 2nd conjugation. In Kapan (D) it is the expected /ɤ/; in Greben (S) it is either a fronted version of this, or the middle fronted vowel /e/; while in Sŭrt (PD) it appears as the high front vowel /i/.
            Examples: dujɤ̀t (D2: 39) // izgud’ə̝̀t (S1: 51), dər’èt (S1: 78) // kreštìt (PD3: 135), vɤr’ìt (PD3: 43)
• The early Slavic “inserted jer” is preserved in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Example: dunèsələ (G1: 188)
• The preposition v ‘in’ appears in the form u.
            Examples: u tòs mom’ènt (D1: 28), u dàmu (G1: 109), u kɤ̀šti (PD2: 74)

"Gigen","19447","","NORTHWESTERN: Bjala Slatina - Pleven
            The easternmost dialects within the larger region of Northwest Bulgarian dialects are known as the Bjala Slatina - Pleven dialect. This group is represented on the website by two villages: Gigen (G) and Petŭrnica (P). Maxim Mladenov (1993: 60, 180) made a subsequent division within this group, citing the nominative form of the first singular pronoun as the isogloss dividing them. He called the western group (with the pronoun ja, jaze) the Bjala Slatina dialect, and the eastern group (with the pronoun az) the Iskŭr-Vit dialect. Both the villages on this site belong to this latter eastern group. In addition, these two villages are characterized by an important feature that both binds them and marks them as different from the majority of the Northwestern region: the historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears as open /ɛ/, distinct from etymological /e/. This development is found in all stressed syllables regardless of the nature of the following syllable. This same feature is found in a relatively small number of villages scattered along the western periphery of the major line dividing all Bulgarian dialects according to the development of this vowel (the “jat” isogloss), all the way from the Danube in the far north to Pazardžik in the central south (Gorno Vŭršilo, also represented on this site) is another one of them). These villages do not differ in any other significant way from their immediate neighbors.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Bjala Slatina - Pleven dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. Because these two villages are not immediate neighbors, their dialects differ in a number of ways. We list first the features common to them, and then those that differentiate them.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village, if there is more than one (e.g. G1 = Gigen 1) or simply the village (P = Petǔrnica), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
COMMON FEATURES
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /ɛ/.
            Examples: dvɛ̀ (G1: 4), gulɛ̀m (G1: 8), dubrɛ̀ (P: 4), živɛ̀le (P: 1)
• Unstressed /o/ is occasionally replaced by /a/.
            Example: bìvale (P: 35)
• Soft  /l’/ is replaced by /j/.
            Examples: bɛ̀jek (P: 11), pojànata (P: 38)
• Soft /t’/ and /d’/ are replaced by /k’/ and /g’/.
            Example: bràk’e (P: 3)
 
Accent
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles.
            Example: skočìa (P: 25),
    This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Example: naràždaa (P: 3)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2nd conjugation verbs.
            Example: poizmòril (G2: 7)
 
Morphology
• The neuter plural formant /t/  is lost in definite forms:
            Example: momčèata (G2: 4)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is /-ɤ/ and when unstressed /-ə/, both of which are the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”.
            Examples: vujnɤ̀ (G1: 1), glavɤ̀ (P: 28)
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form).
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Example: žetvàre (G1: 9)
• The plural ending of the L-participle is /-e/.
            Example: fanàle (G1: 6)
• Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example: jàden’e (P: 51)
• The ending of 1st person plural present tense forms can be either /-me/ or /-m/.
            Examples: živɛ̀eme (P: 4), dɤržìm (P: 35), kopàem (G2: 20)
 
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
Phonology
• The consonant /x/ in verbal endings developed in different ways in the two villages. In Petǔrnica it was replaced by /j/ in final position and before a consonant, whereas in Gigen its loss was “compensated” by lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: dodòjme (P:6), nòsej (P: 37)  // kòse:me (G1: 10).
• The consonant /l/ in syllable-final position remained unchanged in Gigen, but in Petǔrnica it was lost and the preceding vowel was lengthened.
            Examples: poizmòril (G2:7) //  dovè: (P: 10), da:bòka (P: 21);  bì:  (P: 16)
 
Accent
• End stress in adjectives is recorded only in Petŭrnica.
            Examples: nemì (P: 29) // gul’èmi (G1: 4)
• Accent in prefixed first singular present tense forms is sometimes shifted to the initial syllable in Petŭrnica, though this is not consistent. It does not happen in Gigen.
            Examples: zàveda (P: 39) vs. poglèdna (P:14) //  [no relevant examples in Gigen]
 
Morphology
• The shape of the vowel in the plural article in Petǔrnica is either /i/ or /e/, whereas in Gigen the vowel is always pronounced somewhere between the two, as /e̝/. What is interesting is that in Petǔrnica the shape of the vowel in the article is determined by the preceding vowel (the final vowel of the noun in question).
            Examples: ezì̀citi (P: 22),  kon’ète (P: 37) //  kočànite̝ (G2: 22), ofcète̝ (G2: 27).
This is one of the few instances of “vowel harmony” in Bulgarian dialects.

"Drjanovec","11196","Razgrad","NORTHEASTERN: MOESIAN: Greben (Garvan, Srebŭna), Sŭrt (Petrov Dol), Drjanovec (Kapan)
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. According to Miletič’s definition, the Moesian group extends to the river Jantra in the west, and in the past even as far west as the “jat”-boundary, the basic division line between western and eastern macro-dialects (Miletich 1903). There are several sub-dialects within the Moesian group that form relatively small islands, but most of the territory is unspecified, simply called Moesian (see the IBL dialect map at http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/). Although there is no single unifying feature, but rather characteristic Moesian traits that overlap from region to region but do not cover the whole area, the speech of the area is immediately recognizable as Moesian.
            Three of the four recognizable islands within Moesian are represented on this website: the two villages Garvan (G) and Srebŭrna (S) represent the Greben variety; the village Petrov Dol (PD) represents the Sŭrt variety, and the village Drjanovec (D) represents the Kapan variety.

            Examples: dèn’ (D1: 60), p’èt’ (D1: 65), pɤ̀t’ (G2: 17), d’èsit’ (PD2: 22)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: innà (D1: 59), plànne (G1: 145), klɤnn’ì (PD3: 33)
• The vowel /i/ is sometimes inserted before an initial consonant cluster.
            Examples: ismɤ̀kvə (G1: 68), iskɤ̀swə (S2: 51)
• There is a regional difference in the behavior of the sequence /str/: it is replaced by /sr/ in Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D) varieties but not in Sŭrt (PD).
            Examples: srùvɤ (D1: 124), sràf (G2: 29), srigɤ̀t (S2: 2) // strɤ̀ka (PD 2: 24)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: dɤ̀ski (G1: 123), sèstri (S1: 76), glàvi (S2: 130)
• There is frequent occurence of a secondary stress on the plural definite article; this also occurs, though less frequently, on feminine and neuter singular articles.
            Examples: màjki̥t’ȅ (D2: 16), pìtkit’ȅ (PD2: 34), drùgit’ȅ (G1: 173) // kul’àntȕ (D1: 25), rìz:tȁ (G1: 173)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for polysyllabic nouns is /-e/, though /i/ appears as well.
            Examples: əjdučòre (G2: 28), misàl’e (PD2: 89), rəkòe (PD3: 48), kumšìe (D2: 20) // məsùri (S2: 124), svədbàri (S1: 67)
• There is regional difference with respect to the ending of feminine nouns when stressed. In Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D), it is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/, whereas in Sǔrt (PD), it is /a/.
            Examples: glɤvɤ̀tə (D2: 11), rɤkɤ̀ (G1: 69), strənɤ̀ (S2: 143)// guràta (PD1: 24), vudà (PD2: 19)
               These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In the Greben and Kapan groups, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns, while in the Sŭrt group it was the old nominative case in /a/  which continued as their single form.  
• There is regional difference in the form of the definite article for masculine singular nouns.  In Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D), it is /-o/ (when unstressed, /-u/), but in Sǔrt (PD) it is /-ɤ/.
            Examples: məžò (G1: 5), zèt’u (S1: 67), dulàpu (D1: 17), tòju (G1: 60) // pragɤ̀ (PD1: 31), zbòrɤ (PD2: 123), trètijɤ (PD1: 71)
• Some indefinite adjectives appear in the long form.
            Examples: drùgij (D1: 49), nàšij (D1: 71), šèstij (PD2: 5)
• Personal pronouns are used as demonstrative.
            Examples: n’ègu dèn’ (D1: 60), nègu bòp (S2: 181), t’àw xòra (D1: 20), tè misàl’e (PD: 89)
• There is regional difference in the form of the back nasal in 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense endings of the 2nd conjugation. In Kapan (D) it is the expected /ɤ/; in Greben (S) it is either a fronted version of this, or the middle fronted vowel /e/; while in Sŭrt (PD) it appears as the high front vowel /i/.
            Examples: dujɤ̀t (D2: 39) // izgud’ə̝̀t (S1: 51), dər’èt (S1: 78) // kreštìt (PD3: 135), vɤr’ìt (PD3: 43)
• The early Slavic “inserted jer” is preserved in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Example: dunèsələ (G1: 188)
• The preposition v ‘in’ appears in the form u.
            Examples: u tòs mom’ènt (D1: 28), u dàmu (G1: 109), u kɤ̀šti (PD2: 74)

"Gradec","11195","Vidin","NORTHWESTERN: Vidin - Lom
 
            Within the larger region of Northwest Bulgarian dialects, the Vidin-Lom dialect group is a recognized category. On this website, the Vidin-Lom group is represented by three villages: Arčar (A), Gradec (G), and Vladimirovo (V). Maxim Mladenov (1993: 60-61) made a subsequent division within this group, citing the form of the future particle as the isogloss dividing them. He called only the western group (with the future particle če) by the name Vidin-Lom, and termed the eastern group (with the future particle šeor ša) the Cibrica-Ogosta group. According to this division then, Arčar and Gradec belong to the Vidin-Lom group, while Vladimirovo belongs to the Cibrica-Ogosta group.
            Dialect speech from the Vidin-Lom dialect group (in either the narrower or the broader interpretation) is very similar to the colloquial register of the capital city of Sofia – that register associated with less educated Sofia residents. It is so close, in fact, that migrants to Sofia from the Vidin-Lom region find it so easy to blend in linguistically to their new habitat that they usually fail to notice what still distinguishes their speech. One such feature is the advancement of accent to the theme vowel in the aorist form of verbs. The difference is that Sofia speech advances the accent in all verb classes, while the Vidim-Lom dialect advances it only in verbs with no prefix (or with a non-syllabic prefix).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Vidin-Lom dialect group. It is based on the speech of the three villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. While not all these features can be found in urban speech with the Vidin-Lom region, few can be totally excluded, at least as variables.
 
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. A1 = Arčar 1, A2 = Arčar 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology.
The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: izbèga (A1: 29), pèsɤk (A1: 38), umrèla (G1: 8)
Etymological “ja” is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples: jàla (G 1:43), jàjca(V2: 111) // čèkaj (A1: 6), edèš (G1: 70)
Unstressed /o/ is occasionally replaced by /a/.
            Example: vadìci (G1: 47), tavà (G1: 33)
There are frequent vowel assimilations.
            Examples: bàam (G1: 7), koto (G1: 57), mòo (V1,104), ko o čùš (V2: 75)
                   Note: the form tavà (GI: 33) may be a result of this as well.
The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged:
            Examples: gṛkl’àna (G1: 53), tṛbì (A1: 4), sḷ̀nčička (G1: 50);
The consonant /x/ is lost intervocalically. After a front vowel it may go to /j/.
            Examples: otidème (A1: 7), meùre (G1: 53); mèj (V2: 95).
Epenthetic /l/ is preserved in the word for “earth”.
            Example: zeml’àta (G2: 25);
Soft consonants are relatively rare. Only /k/,/g/,/l/,and /n/ have soft correlates, but they are not used in masculine definite forms and verbal endings.
            Example: žènat (V2: 18)
Alveolar consonants become postalveolar before palatals.
            Example: bàšn’a (G1: 3)
Soft /t’/and /d’/are replaced by /k’/and /g’/.
            Examples: gòsk’e (V1: 43), gròzg’e (V1: 72).
 
Accent
The accent is retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns
            Examples: vòda (V2: 42), rɤ̀ce (G1: 112), ùsta (G1: 35), dṛ̀va (A1: 29), jàjca (V2: 111)
      This is not completely consistent, however.
            Examples: rekà (G2: 7), detè (G2: 13)
The accent shifts to the end in some adjectives.
            Example: mutà (G1: 33)
The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles.
            Examples: stignà (A1: 50), padnàle (A1: 4)
    This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: isìpa (A1: 49), obèsila (G1: 18)
The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2d conjugation verbs.
            Examples: svàri( A2: 29), ròdim (G1: 75)
 
Morphology
The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative  jà (G1: 7)
            3rd singular nominative  òn (A1: 12), onà (G1: 18, onò (A1: 36)
            3rd plural nominative onì (G2: 6)
            3rd plural accusative  n’ì (A1: 13)
            3rd plural dative short form ngi (V1: 102), gim (A1: 2)
The plural of masculine (and occasionally feminine) nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: masculine meùre (G1: 53), feminine kèle (G1: 49)
The masculine singular definite article in nouns is /-ɤ/ if stressed and /-a/ (or /-ɤ/) if not.
            Examples: gṛdɤ̀ (G1: 51), džàma (G1: 51)
    In adjectives the articles is /-ea/, found most consistently in Gradec.
            Example: màlkea (G2: 2)
     (Note: the lowering of /i/ to /e/ seems restricted to these forms, but is also recorded in the verb napràvea (G1: 65).
The ending in all 1st person singular present tense forms is /-m/.
            Example: mèrim (A1: 6)
The ending in all 1st person plural present tense forms is /-me/.
            Example: donesème (A2: 25).
The future particle is either če or še/ša.
            Examples: če se svàri (A2: 29) // še mi kùpite (G1: 23)
In western regions the imperfect tense incorporates the morpheme /-še-/ in all forms.
            Example: ìmašeme (A2: 38)
The plural ending for the L-participle is /-e/.
            Example: istṛ̀pnale (G1 126)
Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example:kòpan’e (V1: 67).
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY on the dialect of Vladimirovo, from the Cibrica-Ogosta group.
In addition to the future particle, mentioned above, this dialect is further distinguished by:
Compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel after the loss of /x/.
            Example:  òde:me (V2: 20)
The replacement of soft /l’/ by /j/.
            Example: trevojàci (V2: 121)
Inconsistent use of the count plural.
            Examples trì pràznici (V1: 104), but also trì dèna (V2: 9).

"Sveta Petka","10870","Velingrad","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Velingrad: transitional (Graševo / Sveta Petka)
            The name Velingrad, used here to refer to the three villages of Sǔrnica, Graševo and Sveta Petka, is not intended as a specific dialect group name. It is rather the name of the relevant administrative region, and is chosen here as a cover term for a number of reasons. The established term “Čepino dialects” refers to the general region, but none of the three villages on this site are among the seven named as part of Čepino in the classic source discussing this dialect (Miletič 1912: 8). When used as a geographical term, “Čepino” includes those original seven cited by Miletič plus two more, one of which is Sveta Petka (Čankov 1958: 499).  
            Linguistically, each of the three villages on the site is both close to the Čepino dialect, and distinct from it in particular ways. Although Graševo and Sveta Petka are geographically closer to the Čepino group, their dialects are less similar to it and in fact have a number of features connecting them with the Razlog-Babjak dialect group. By contrast, Sǔrnica is geographically further from the Čepino group, but has more dialectal features in common with it. The solution taken here, therefore, is to group all three under the administrative term Velingrad, but to describe Sǔrnica separately from Graševo and Sveta Petka.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the dialects of Graševo and Sveta Petka. It is based on the speech of those villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. G = Graševo) the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. SP1 = Sveta Petka 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat’” appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/ in Sveta Petka, whereas in Graševo it appears as /e/, except after /c/ where it is /a/.
            Examples: golɛ̀mi (SP1: 151), bɛ̀lo (SP1: 39), sɛ̀kakvu (SP1: 94) // nèkuj (G: 67), vidèl (G: 84), tèh (106) // càl’ (G: 121)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are either /a/ or /ɛ/.
            Examples: š’arkite (SP1: 75), udž’ɛ̀k (SP2: 13)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back jer” appears as /a/ in the root, but as /o/ in affixes and in the masculine singular definite article.
            Examples: isàhne (G: 93), snài (G: 131) // kakòf (SP3: 132), veterò (SP3: 99)
• The historical Slavic vowel “ back nasal” appears as /a/.
            Examples: kàštə (SP3: 13), pàt (SP3: 84)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /r/ appears as /rɤ/.
            Examples: vrɤvɛ̀a (SP1: 29), drɤ̀vo (SP1: 121)
• The early South Slavic sequence “čr + front jer” appears as /č’ɤr/.
            Example: č’ɤrno (SP1: 39)
• The initial sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /fn/.
            Example: fnògu (SP1: 49)
• The sequence /vn/ is assimilated to /mn/.
            Example: plɛ̀mn’a (SP: 29)
• The sequence /sr/ occasionally appears as /str/.
            Examples: stredàta (SP1: 109), but also sredàta (SP3: 66)
• Soft /t’/ is occasionally replaced by soft /k’/.
            Example: pràpak’ (SP: 63)
• Soft consonants may appear word-finally.
            Examples: rudàn’ (G: 94), pràpak’ (SP2: 63)
• There is a schwa-like release of final consonants as marker of unfinished phrase.
            Examples: imòtə (G: 65), pàzərdžikə (SP1: 43)

"Oborište","10869","Panagjurište","NORTHEASTERN: WESTERN BALKAN:  Panagjurište / Teteven 
            The Western Balkan dialect group consists of the dialects of Panagjurište, Pirdop, and Teteven; the BDLT site includes one village representing the Panagjurište dialect, Oborište (O), and one representing the Teteven dialect, Vasiljovo (V).
            The Western Balkan group has been recognized as such only by Bojadžiev (1981: 175); it is not mentioned by other major classifications of Bulgarian dialects (Miletich 1903, Stojkov 1993, and the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/). What has presumably kept other sources from recognizing these dialects as a single group is the fact that they differ with respect to one important feature, the continuant of the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” (which is /ɤ/  in Panagurište, /a / in Pirdop, and the broad vowel /ɛ/  in Teteven). Otherwise, because these dialects do share such a large number of common features, we follow Bojadžiev in viewing them as a separate linguistic unit, the Western Balkan group.
            What makes this group “western” is the presence of at least three features shared with the Western dialects, namely accent advancement in aorist forms and L-participles of unprefixed verbs, hard consonants before the endings 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense verbs, and the fact of insignificant changes in the quality of unstressed vowels. What makes it undoubtedly part of the Balkan group, however, is the behavior of the historical Slavic vowel “jat”.
            There is an additional curious feature about the dialect of Teteven in that it is only one of two dialects throughout Bulgaria in which the vowel /ɛ/  appears with the lexical distribution of the vowel /ɤ/  in the standard language and in many dialects. The other dialect is that of Erkeč, located at the easternmost edge of the Balkan mountain range, physically quite distant from the Teteven region. But whereas this vowel is regularly heard in Erkeč, even in the speech of children, it is more limited in Teteven, where speakers will use it,  the younger ones perhaps with some exaggeration, only when asked to talk “in the old way”.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Western Balkan dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. We list first the features common to them, and then those that differentiate the Panagjurište group (represented by Oborište) from the Teteven one (represented by Vasiljovo).
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village, if there is more than one (e.g. O1 = Oborište 1, V2 = Vasiljovo 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
COMMON FEATURES
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/,  depending on the nature of the following syllable or the coda of the syllable itself (a following soft consonant can also condition /e/). This development is common to nearly all other Balkan dialects, and also characterizes the standard language. The specific feature of Western Balkan dialects is that /’a/ appears before post-alveolar fricatives.
            Examples: l’aba  (O1: 7), pr’àsno  (O1: 34), sed’ànka  (V1: 28), ml’àku  (V1: 38) // živèe  (O1: 80), gol’èmi  (V1: 21) // n’àštu  (O1: 57)
 
• The results of the the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those for “jat”. Here the specific features of Western Balkan dialects is that it appears as /a/  after post-alveolar consonants, and /e/  after /j/.
            Examples: dɤržàle  (O1: 96), godežàre  (V1: 59) // jèzdat  (V1: 67), èzdat  (V1: 68), ègnetḁtḁ  (O: 139), èjca  (O: 70)
      The first two examples with /e/  appear to contradict the rule in that there is no soft consonant or front vowel in the syllable following, and the second two appear to contradict it in that there is no initial /j/.  Historically the correct “triggers” were present, however. In the first instance there used to be a soft consonant before the verbal ending but it subsequently hardened in this and other dialects; and in the second, the following front vowel caused the loss of initial /j/.
• The consonant /x/  is lost in 1st person plural past tense forms; this loss is “compensated” by lengthening of the preceding vowel:
            Examples: ìma:me  (V1: 22), zbìra:me  (V1: 2), òde:me  (V2: 21), vìka:me  (O2: 57)
• The sequence /mn/  is dissimilated to /vn/  between two vowels.
            Example: zìvnici  (O1: 78) // [no examples for Vasiljovo]
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: rɛ̀ka  (V1: 91), vòda  (V1: 186), rɤ̀ka  (O1: 173), vòda  (O1: 142)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present tense of many verbs of the 2nd conjugation.
            Examples: vàrim  (V1: 35), svàlim  (O1: 52), izdòat  (O1: 134), utài  (O1: 154)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles.
            Examples: stanɛ̀  (V1: 3), sipàle  (V1: 49), kupìle  (V1: 71), stanàxme  (O1: 57), pazìla  (O1: 44), slagàla  (O1: 47)
    This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: zagìna  (V1: 22), zabràila  (V1: 63), napràvihme  (O1: 56)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns is the vowel which is the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal” (the actual form of which is one of the major differences between the sub-groups of Western Balkan; see below for more commentary).
            Examples: dɤskɤ̀  (O1: 15), ofcɤ̀  (O1: 97), vojnɛ̀ta  (V1: 5), rekɛ̀ta  (V1: 47)         
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/  as their single form).
• The unstressed form of the masculine definite article is /-a/;  the stressed form is the vowel which is the result of the historical Slavic “back jer” (the actual form of which is one of the major differences between the sub-groups of Western Balkan; see below for more commentary).
            kvasɤ̀  (O1: 14), l’àba  (O1: 39) // gradɛ̀  (V2: 4), pòpa  (V1: 86)
• The plural ending of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: kravàje  (V1: 40), gajdàre  (V2: 23), kalɤ̀pe  (O1: 114)
• The consonant before 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense endings in the 2nd conjugation is hard.
            Examples: pòmna  (V1: 8), gònat  (V1: 23), razvalɤ̀  (O1: 15), delɤ̀t  (O2: 37), pokànɤtə  (O2: 29)
• The plural ending of L-participles is /-e/.
            Examples: zè̝le  (V1: 47), sipàle, gledàle  (O1: 96), dɤržàle  (O1: 26)
 
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “ back nasal” appear as /ɤ/  in the Panagjurište dialect (except for the prefix vɤz- , where the “back jer” appears as /o/). In the Teteven dialect, these vowels appear as /ɛ/  in stressed syllables and /a/  in unstressed ones.
            Examples for back nasal: rɤ̀ka  (O1: 173), okɤ̀pa  (O2: 42) // pɛ̀t’a  (V1: 60), rɛ̀ka  (V1: 91), dòdat  (O2: 29), rac’ète  (V1: 51)
            Example for back jer: presɤ̀:va  (O2: 48) // vɛ̀nka  (V1: 83); dobìtak  (V1: 38)
            Example for back jer in prefix: vozidè  (O1: 22), voziòdi  (O1: 27)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /r/  appears as syllabic /ṛ/  in Teteven, but in Panagjurište it is as in the standard language.
            Examples: sṛ̀bete  (V1: 4), pṛ̀stenete  (V1: 46) // vɤ̀rne  (O2: 92), vrɤ̀bnica  (O2: 40).
• The vowel /e/  is frequently raised in stressed syllables in Teteven, but not in Panagjurište.
            Examples: žè̝nena  (V1: 2). momčè̝ta  (V1: 29), zasè̝lile  (V2: 3) // pedesèta  (O1: 62), ofcète  (O1: 93)
• The consonant /j/ is lost between two vowels in Panagjurište but retained in Teteven.
            Examples: nèa  (O1: 9), ogrèa  (O1: 13), izdòat  (O1: 134) // pejàa  (V1: 7), krəvàje  (V1: 40)
• Voicing is retained in the preposition “v” in Panagjurište but not in Teteven.
            Example: v onìja  (O1: 26) // vəf rəkɛ̀ta  (V1: 47)
• There is a schwa-like release of final consonants as marker of unfinished phrase in Panagjurište.
            Examples: kvàsə  (O1: 14), l’àpə  (O1: 16)
 
Morphology
• The formant /-t/  is lacking from the definite plural forms of neuter nouns in Teteven, but present in Panagjurište.
            Examples: momìčeata  (V1: 27), momčè̝ata  (V1: 30) // kačètata  (O1: 158)
• The future can be formed with the complementizer da  in Panagjurište but not in Teteven.
            Example: še da ìdem  (O2: 62) // še zakòlim  (V1: 86)

"Belica","10868","Ixtiman","SOUTHWESTERN: Ihtiman
            The Ihtiman dialect is represented on this website by two villages, Gorno Vŭršilo (GV) and Belica (B), although strictly speaking only the first of these belongs directly to the Ihtiman group. The Belica dialect is considered to be transitional between the Panagjurište dialect and the Ihtiman dialect, with two major features connecting it to the former and only one to the latter (Mladenov 1966: 16). Since this latter feature (the current form of the historical Slavic vowel “jat”) is usually considered to be more important, Belica is here included in the Ihtiman group. In a way, in fact, both dialects are somewhat marginal, since Gorno Vŭršilo is one of only four villages (out of total of 24 belonging to Ihtiman dialect) in which the form of the historical “jat” vowel in stressed syllables is the open front vowel /ɛ/ (as in the villages on this site representing the Bjala Slatina - Pleven group).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Ihtiman dialect group. It is based on the speech of the above two villages, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. GV1 = Gorno Vŭršilo 1, B2 = Belica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears as /ɛ/ in Gorno Vŭršilo and as /e/ in Belica.
            Examples: lɛ̀te (GV1: 13), sɛ̀no (GV1: 2) // bèx (B1: 4), golèma (B1: 16)
     After the consonant /c/, it appears as /a/ in both villages.
            Examples: càla (GV1: 52), precàždaš (B3: 20)
• The historical sequence “ja”  (including the sequence “post-alveolar + a”) is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples: vejàčka (GV1: 9), tojàga (B3: 37) // čèkat (B1: 45), edè (B1: 59)
• Both the historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” merge into a single vowel; in many instances the historical Slavic vowel “front jer” joins them. The result of this merger is /a/ in Gorno Vǔršilo and /ɤ/ in Belica.
            Examples of “back jer”: časà (GV2: 5) // dɤ̀ski (B2: 144), vɤ̀nka (B2: 142)
            Examples of “back nasal: pàte (GV2: 3), sedàt (GV1: 17) // kɤ̀šti (B1: 17), mɤ̀š (B1: 32)
            Examples of  “front jer”: žàne:me (GV1: 6) // žɤ̀na (B1: 24);
     This is the major trait connecting Belica with the dialect of Panagjurište (and not Ihtiman).
• The historical Slavic “front nasal” appears as /ɤ/ after post-alveolar consonants, i.e. with the same result as the historical Slavic “back nasal” (this is usually termed “merger of nasals”).
            Examples: [no examples from GV] // žɤ̀tva (B1: 35)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged:
            Examples: nafṛ̀l’am (GV1: 26), vṛ̀va (GV1: 27), dṛ̀veni (B1: 52), napḷna (B3: 79), napḷ̀nila (B3: 81)
• The consonant /x/ is preserved word-finally and lost in other positions. When it is lost before consonant, the preceding vowel is lengthened.
            Examples: zaprèx (GV1: 20), bèx (b1: 4), tèx (B1: 128), dokàraa (GV1: 17) // kòpa:me (GV1: 6), potkarvà:me (B1: 102)
• Intervocalic /j/ is lost in Belica but preserved in Gorno Vŭršilo.
            Examples: veàčki (B2: 52), nàsea (B2: 72) // vejàčka (GV1: 9)
• Voicing is retained in the preposition /v/.
            Examples: v ihtimàn (GV2: 22), v armàna (B2: 30)
• There is a schwa-like release of final consonants as a marker of an unfinished phrase.
            Examples: grùkə (B2: 40), ovèsə (B2: 99), smɛ̀xə (GV2: 6), kòpamə (GV2: 8)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: vṛ̀va (GV1: 27), zàmesa (GV1: 27), òra (B1: 25), òbṛza (B2: 71)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present tense of many 2nd conjugation verbs.
            Examples: sàdim (GV2: 62), ogràdim (B2: 25), ulòvim (B2: 29)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles.
            Examples: žɤnà (B1: 55), ranì:me (GV2: 42), vadìla (GV1: 2), gledàla (B1: 22)
     This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: ožènixme (GV2: 37), presèlia (B1: 5), zarèza:me (B1: 104)
 
Morphology
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: kàmene (GV1: 42), tràktore (GV1: 11), čuvàle (B2: 112), samùne (B2: 116)
• The form of the masculine singular definite article in nouns is /-ɤ/ in Belica, and alternates between /-a/ and /-e/ (depending on the nature of the preceding consonant) in Gorno Vŭršilo.
            Examples: studɤ̀ (B2: 87) // lɛ̀ba (GV1: 13), pàte (GV2: 3)  
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”. In Belica this is /ɤ/, and in Gorno Vǔršilo it is /a/.
            Examples: branɤ̀ (B2: 82), dɤskɤ̀ (B2: 126) // stranà (GV 2: 53)
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialect, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form). Of course, when the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal” is /a/ (as in GV), there is no way to differentiate the two results.
• Verbs of the 2nd conjugation have hard consonants preceding the endings of 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense forms.
            Examples: pèčela (B1: 19), zàmesa (GV1: 26) // rèdat  (B2: 149), napḷ̀nat (GV 1:30)
• The future particle in B is šta for 1st person singular and šte (or še) elswhere; in GV it is consistently še.
            Examples: šta lìsna (B3: 83), šte mi vṛ̀zva (B1: 129), šte go jadè (B2: 58) // še ìde (GV 2: 34)
• The plural ending of L-participles is /-e/.
            Examples: gledàle (GV2: 66), otišlè (B1: 89), turìle (B2: 126)

"Vŭrbina ","10391","Ardino","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Zlatograd
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            The dialect of Zlatograd is represented on the website by the villages Leštak (L) and Vŭrbina (V).  These villages, in fact, are transitional to the Smoljan dialect, with major traits connecting them to the Smoljan dialect on the one hand, and to the Zlatograd dialect on the other.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Zlatograd dialect. It is based on the speech of the two villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. L1 = Leštak 1, V2 = Vŭrbina 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/  or /e/;  the former is more frequent in Leštak, and the latter is more frequent in Vŭrbina. After the consonant /c/  in the word ‘entire’ it appears as /a/.
            Examples: gulɛ̀mi  (L1: 45), mlɛ̀ku  (L1: 3) mɛ̀stu  (L2: 69), v’ɛ̀lu  (V1: 11), l’ɛ̀hi  (V3: 36); prolètenu  (L2: 29), l’èbə  (V2: 62) // càlənə  (L1: 32), càltə  (V2: 51)
• The  historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat” appear in stressed syllables as /ɛ/.
            Examples: čɛ̀snicite  (L1: 5), tujɛ̀gə  (L3: 410), kujədž’ɛ̀k  (L2: 80), kučɛ̀ni  (V4: 53), užɛ̀ci  (V3: 53)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “ back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/  or /ʌ/. (See below for commentary on the vowel /ʌ/).
            Examples for back jer:  dʌ̀ski  (L1: 20), isʌ̀hne  (L2: 42), dɤ̀šterə ( V3: 55)
            Examples for back nasal: nəzɤ̀benku  (L3: 151), prʌ̀čkə  (L3: 406), mɤ̀ž’uve  (V1: 37)
     It is this trait (back jer  and back nasal appearing as /ɤ/  or /ʌ/)  that connects the speech of these villages with the Zlatograd dialect.
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/  or /’ʌ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, although all such words can also optionally occur with /e/.
            Examples for front jer:  l’ɤsnu  (L1: 77, V1: 39), z’ɤ̀meš  (L1: 33), l’ʌ̀ku  (L3: 101);           l’èku  (V4: 42)
            Examples for front nasal: gl’ɤ̀dəli  (V1: 23), ispr’ɤ̀denə,  m’ʌ̀su  (L1: 65), jʌ̀dri  (L3: 134), gl’èdəš  (L2: 35)
     As elsewhere in the Rhodopes, the merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers  and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a significant defining feature of their “Rhodope” affiliation. (Miletič 1912: 29). Indeed, it is this trait that connects the speech of these two villages with the Smoljan dialect.
    Note on the vowel /ʌ/:  In Vŭrbina, the vowel /ʌ/ is a phonetic variant appearing after labial consonants; in Leštak, however, it is the basic variant and appears nearly everywhere.
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɤr/  and /ɤl/.
            Examples: pɤ̀rs  (V4: 92), vɤ̀rštəm  (V2: 60), nəpɤ̀lni  (L3: 424), bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23)
• The vowel /i/  is replaced by /’u/  before labial consonants. The reverse change, the replacement of /u/  after soft consonant by /i/,  is attested only in Vŭrbina.
            Examples for /i/ > /’u/:  l’uvàtki  (L2: 70), čuvìjə  (L3: 363), ž’uvèi  (V1: 39) 
            Example for /u/ > /i/:  jinìcə  (V2: 37)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: càrvicə  (L1: 28), tvàr’ət  (L1: 20), càltu  (V2: 51), zvè̝me  (V2: 18)
• The consonant /x/  is replaced by /h/  in all positions, and is sometimes lost word-initially.
            Examples: isʌ̀hne  (L2: 57), bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23) hòd’əm  (V3: 45) // l’èbə  (V2: 62), umòt’  (L3: 232)
• With rare exceptions, the affricate /dž/  is replaced by the fricative /ž/.
            Examples: g’um’urz’ìne (V1: 27), bəžɤ̀nə  (V3: 106), sež’ìm  (L3:   267) // kujədž’ɛ̀k (L2: 80)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: umòt’  (L3: 232), fəsul’  (V4: 9)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23), vɤ̀l’n’eni  (V4: 83)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: rɤ̀kə  (L3: 157), kòzə  (L1: 85), bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23); t’èle  (L1: 85), dɤ̀rvu  (V4: 104)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the 1st person singular present tense form.
            Examples: òmur’ə  (V3: 59), s’èdəm  (V3: 48)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperatives.
            Examples: vɤ̀ri  (L1: 41), òpeni  (L3: 424), zàkuli  (V2: 24)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: həjvàne  (L3: 75), kətɤ̀re  (L3: 56), kàmene  (V4: 94)
• Feminine nouns ending in a consonant have shifted to the masculine gender.
            Examples: sɤ̀štijə kàl  (V4: 92), ədɨ̀n p̀è̝š  (V2: 51)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: metlɤ̀ (L3: 43), pl’əvɤ̀nə (V1: 10)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for ‘arm’ and ‘leg’ is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rɤ̀ki  (V3: 84), nògi  (V3: 42)
• A significant defining feature of Rhodope dialects is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: sʌ̀rpəs  (L2: 42), mesòtu  (L1: 88), l’ɛ̀tunu  (L1: 31)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (or /-so/,  /-no/).
            Examples: kòl’etu  (L1: 82), snòpetu  (L3: 54) // [no examples of proximal or distal articles attested in the texts]
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
            Examples: sàe  (L1: 4), tva’  (l1: 56), nvà  (V4: 70)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (L1: 23)
            3rd plural accusative: hi  (V4: 72) or i  (V4: 30)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function.
            Examples: nɛ̀kvə l’uvàtkə  (L2: 70), nɛ̀kəf kujədž’ɛ̀k  (L2: 80), n’èkvə gudɨ̀nə  (V3: 104)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kinà (L2: 83, V2: 15)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrɤ̀  (V4: 4)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: vrìt (L2: 54)
• Verbs of all three conjugations have the same endings in 1st person singular present tense forms of unprefixed verbs: /-m/. In prefixed verbs it is either /-m/  or /-a/.
            Examples: hòd’əm  (V3: 45), s’edəm  (V3: 48) // zàmes’əm  (V2: 60), òmur’ə  (V3: 59)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: bilìli ( L2: 44), dušlìli  (V4: 3)
• Passive participles are frequently formed with the suffix /-t/.
            Examples: iskuvàtu  (V3: 88), sml’èti  (V1: 54)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Examples: fàtəš  (L2: 44), ràdəhə  (V4: 75)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
Three phonetic features are found in Vŭrbina, but not in Leštak.
• The vowel /e/  is frequently raised in stressed syllables, including as a reflex of “jat”.
            Examples: pè̝čki  (V3: 103), pè̝š  (V2: 61), mè̝secə  (V2: 26)
• The vowel /i/  is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: sɨ̀tu  (V1: 9), gudɨ̀nə  (V3: 72)
• The vowel /o/  in stressed syllables is replaced by /wo/.
            Examples: wòs’em  (V3: 82), wògən’ən  (V3: 103), nətwòč’eni  (V3: 8)

"Vasiljovo","10390","Teteven","NORTHEASTERN: WESTERN BALKAN:  Panagjurište / Teteven 
            The Western Balkan dialect group consists of the dialects of Panagjurište, Pirdop, and Teteven; the BDLT site includes one village representing the Panagjurište dialect, Oborište (O), and one representing the Teteven dialect, Vasiljovo (V).
            The Western Balkan group has been recognized as such only by Bojadžiev (1981: 175); it is not mentioned by other major classifications of Bulgarian dialects (Miletich 1903, Stojkov 1993, and the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/). What has presumably kept other sources from recognizing these dialects as a single group is the fact that they differ with respect to one important feature, the continuant of the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” (which is /ɤ/  in Panagurište, /a / in Pirdop, and the broad vowel /ɛ/  in Teteven). Otherwise, because these dialects do share such a large number of common features, we follow Bojadžiev in viewing them as a separate linguistic unit, the Western Balkan group.
            What makes this group “western” is the presence of at least three features shared with the Western dialects, namely accent advancement in aorist forms and L-participles of unprefixed verbs, hard consonants before the endings 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense verbs, and the fact of insignificant changes in the quality of unstressed vowels. What makes it undoubtedly part of the Balkan group, however, is the behavior of the historical Slavic vowel “jat”.
            There is an additional curious feature about the dialect of Teteven in that it is only one of two dialects throughout Bulgaria in which the vowel /ɛ/  appears with the lexical distribution of the vowel /ɤ/  in the standard language and in many dialects. The other dialect is that of Erkeč, located at the easternmost edge of the Balkan mountain range, physically quite distant from the Teteven region. But whereas this vowel is regularly heard in Erkeč, even in the speech of children, it is more limited in Teteven, where speakers will use it,  the younger ones perhaps with some exaggeration, only when asked to talk “in the old way”.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Western Balkan dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. We list first the features common to them, and then those that differentiate the Panagjurište group (represented by Oborište) from the Teteven one (represented by Vasiljovo).
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village, if there is more than one (e.g. O1 = Oborište 1, V2 = Vasiljovo 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
COMMON FEATURES
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/,  depending on the nature of the following syllable or the coda of the syllable itself (a following soft consonant can also condition /e/). This development is common to nearly all other Balkan dialects, and also characterizes the standard language. The specific feature of Western Balkan dialects is that /’a/ appears before post-alveolar fricatives.
            Examples: l’aba  (O1: 7), pr’àsno  (O1: 34), sed’ànka  (V1: 28), ml’àku  (V1: 38) // živèe  (O1: 80), gol’èmi  (V1: 21) // n’àštu  (O1: 57)
 
• The results of the the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those for “jat”. Here the specific features of Western Balkan dialects is that it appears as /a/  after post-alveolar consonants, and /e/  after /j/.
            Examples: dɤržàle  (O1: 96), godežàre  (V1: 59) // jèzdat  (V1: 67), èzdat  (V1: 68), ègnetḁtḁ  (O: 139), èjca  (O: 70)
      The first two examples with /e/  appear to contradict the rule in that there is no soft consonant or front vowel in the syllable following, and the second two appear to contradict it in that there is no initial /j/.  Historically the correct “triggers” were present, however. In the first instance there used to be a soft consonant before the verbal ending but it subsequently hardened in this and other dialects; and in the second, the following front vowel caused the loss of initial /j/.
• The consonant /x/  is lost in 1st person plural past tense forms; this loss is “compensated” by lengthening of the preceding vowel:
            Examples: ìma:me  (V1: 22), zbìra:me  (V1: 2), òde:me  (V2: 21), vìka:me  (O2: 57)
• The sequence /mn/  is dissimilated to /vn/  between two vowels.
            Example: zìvnici  (O1: 78) // [no examples for Vasiljovo]
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: rɛ̀ka  (V1: 91), vòda  (V1: 186), rɤ̀ka  (O1: 173), vòda  (O1: 142)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present tense of many verbs of the 2nd conjugation.
            Examples: vàrim  (V1: 35), svàlim  (O1: 52), izdòat  (O1: 134), utài  (O1: 154)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles.
            Examples: stanɛ̀  (V1: 3), sipàle  (V1: 49), kupìle  (V1: 71), stanàxme  (O1: 57), pazìla  (O1: 44), slagàla  (O1: 47)
    This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: zagìna  (V1: 22), zabràila  (V1: 63), napràvihme  (O1: 56)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns is the vowel which is the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal” (the actual form of which is one of the major differences between the sub-groups of Western Balkan; see below for more commentary).
            Examples: dɤskɤ̀  (O1: 15), ofcɤ̀  (O1: 97), vojnɛ̀ta  (V1: 5), rekɛ̀ta  (V1: 47)         
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/  as their single form).
• The unstressed form of the masculine definite article is /-a/;  the stressed form is the vowel which is the result of the historical Slavic “back jer” (the actual form of which is one of the major differences between the sub-groups of Western Balkan; see below for more commentary).
            kvasɤ̀  (O1: 14), l’àba  (O1: 39) // gradɛ̀  (V2: 4), pòpa  (V1: 86)
• The plural ending of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: kravàje  (V1: 40), gajdàre  (V2: 23), kalɤ̀pe  (O1: 114)
• The consonant before 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense endings in the 2nd conjugation is hard.
            Examples: pòmna  (V1: 8), gònat  (V1: 23), razvalɤ̀  (O1: 15), delɤ̀t  (O2: 37), pokànɤtə  (O2: 29)
• The plural ending of L-participles is /-e/.
            Examples: zè̝le  (V1: 47), sipàle, gledàle  (O1: 96), dɤržàle  (O1: 26)
 
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “ back nasal” appear as /ɤ/  in the Panagjurište dialect (except for the prefix vɤz- , where the “back jer” appears as /o/). In the Teteven dialect, these vowels appear as /ɛ/  in stressed syllables and /a/  in unstressed ones.
            Examples for back nasal: rɤ̀ka  (O1: 173), okɤ̀pa  (O2: 42) // pɛ̀t’a  (V1: 60), rɛ̀ka  (V1: 91), dòdat  (O2: 29), rac’ète  (V1: 51)
            Example for back jer: presɤ̀:va  (O2: 48) // vɛ̀nka  (V1: 83); dobìtak  (V1: 38)
            Example for back jer in prefix: vozidè  (O1: 22), voziòdi  (O1: 27)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /r/  appears as syllabic /ṛ/  in Teteven, but in Panagjurište it is as in the standard language.
            Examples: sṛ̀bete  (V1: 4), pṛ̀stenete  (V1: 46) // vɤ̀rne  (O2: 92), vrɤ̀bnica  (O2: 40).
• The vowel /e/  is frequently raised in stressed syllables in Teteven, but not in Panagjurište.
            Examples: žè̝nena  (V1: 2). momčè̝ta  (V1: 29), zasè̝lile  (V2: 3) // pedesèta  (O1: 62), ofcète  (O1: 93)
• The consonant /j/ is lost between two vowels in Panagjurište but retained in Teteven.
            Examples: nèa  (O1: 9), ogrèa  (O1: 13), izdòat  (O1: 134) // pejàa  (V1: 7), krəvàje  (V1: 40)
• Voicing is retained in the preposition “v” in Panagjurište but not in Teteven.
            Example: v onìja  (O1: 26) // vəf rəkɛ̀ta  (V1: 47)
• There is a schwa-like release of final consonants as marker of unfinished phrase in Panagjurište.
            Examples: kvàsə  (O1: 14), l’àpə  (O1: 16)
 
Morphology
• The formant /-t/  is lacking from the definite plural forms of neuter nouns in Teteven, but present in Panagjurište.
            Examples: momìčeata  (V1: 27), momčè̝ata  (V1: 30) // kačètata  (O1: 158)
• The future can be formed with the complementizer da  in Panagjurište but not in Teteven.
            Example: še da ìdem  (O2: 62) // še zakòlim  (V1: 86)

"Trjavna","10389","Trjavna","CENTRAL BALKAN -TRJAVNA
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the Central Balkan variety is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Trjavna. It is important to note that the overall Central Balkan group is quite diverse (even the principal unifying feature, the modern results of the historical vowel “jat”, shows variation from region to region). Due to organizational factors concerning the field expeditions which produced the data for the BDLT website, data was obtained only from the town of Trjavna (T) and four villages in its vicinity: Bangejci (B), Černovrŭh (Č), Prestoj (P) and Stančov Han (SH).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the speech of the Trjavna region. It is based on the speech of these five locales as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. P = Prestoj) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Bangejci 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” developed as in the standard language, namely /’a/ before hard syllables and /e/ before soft syllables. There two exceptions with respect to the standard language: the vowel /e/ appears in 1st and 2nd plural past tense forms, and word-finally in aorist forms.
            Examples: zəpr’èhme (B1: 86), b’èxmi (B2: 5), zəpustè (SH3: 9)
    In fact, these forms are regular if one applies the rule strictly: the standard forms are exceptional in displaying /’a/ before a soft syllable.
•  The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: tujàgətə (SH1: 9), təčàh (SH2: 7), venčàvət (Č: 19) // jèrenci (T: 178), tujègi (SH1: 7), təčèhmi (B2: 71), venčèjət (Č: 21)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ between postalveolar and labial consonants.
            Example: žuv’èi (B1: 26)
• The unstressed vowels /e/, /a/, /o/ are pronounced as /i/, /ə/, /u/, respectively; this is very close to what Bulgarian dialectologists call “full vowel reduction”. The pronunciation of unstressed /e/ as /’ə/ is relatively rare.
            Examples: vrit’ènutu (SH1: 58), mitɤ̀ (B1: 36) // grədɤ̀ (B1: 27), krəkàtə (SH1: 72) // udlip’ɤ̀d (P: 70), s’elu (B1: 7) // b’ed’ən (SH1: 14)
  In endings of the imperfect tense, however, /e/ remains unchanged.
            Examples: òd’exa (SH1: 5), rəbòt’exə̥ (SH1: 22), pràvea (B1: 49)
• The consonant /x/ is best preserved (sometimes shifted to /h/) in past tense verbal endings before a consonant. It is frequently lost in all other positions.
            Examples: b’exmi (B2: 5), zəpr’ehmi (B1:86) // òdea (B1: 82), r’èku (SH3: 41), ispupàsuə (T: 140)
    Sometimes this loss is compensated by a lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: isɤ̀:ni (B2: 43), duisɤ̀:ni (B2: 45)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: ìgli (B2: 55), dɤ̀ski (Č: 44)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunction “kato”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kəd gì izvìkəme (T: 150), kəd gì putklədɤ̀t (P: 16), kəd gì izbràxmi (SH3: 36)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/. 
            Examples: zim’ɤ̀ (B1: 69), gurɤ̀tə (Č: 23), vudɤ̀ (B2: 42)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.

"Sŭrnica","10388","Velingrad"," CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Velingrad (Sǔrnica)
            The name Velingrad, used here to refer to the three villages of Sǔrnica, Graševo and Sveta Petka, is not intended as a specific dialect group name. It is rather the name of the relevant administrative region, and is chosen here as a cover term for a number of reasons. The established term is “Čepino dialects”, but none of the three villages on this site are among the seven named as part of Čepino in Miletič’s classic source on the Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912:8). When used as a geographical term, “Čepino” includes those original seven villages cited by Miletič plus two more, one of which is Sveta Petka (Čankov 1958: 499).  
            Linguistically, each of the three villages on the site is both close to the Čepino dialect, and distinct from it in particular ways. Although Graševo and Sveta Petka are geographically closer to the Čepino group, their dialects are less similar to it and in fact have a number of features connecting them with the Razlog-Babjak dialect group. By contrast, Sǔrnica is geographically further from the Čepino group, but has more dialectal features in common with it. The solution taken here, therefore, is to group all three under the administrative term Velingrad, but to describe Sǔrnica separately from Graševo and Sveta Petka.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the dialect of Sǔrnica. It is based on the speech of that village as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. S1 = Sǔrnica 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
            The dialect of Sŭrnica clearly belongs to the Rhodope dialects, in that its vocalic system is characterized by the primary features defining Rhodope dialects; these vowels are discussed below. At the same time the dialect of Sŭrnica stands apart from the core area of Rhodope dialects (as does the Čepino dialect) in that it lacks the tripartite system of definite articles and demonstratives.  
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears as /ɛ/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: vrɛ̀me (S1: 11), nɛ̀štu (S1: 13), d’ɛ̀te (180)
•  The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ubič’ɛ̀j (S1: 60), jɛ̀dene (S1: 70), uvəž’ɛ̀vət (S1: 143)
     The merger of these two (historical “jat” and etymological “ja”) is a basic Rhodope feature.
 • The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/.
            Examples of “back jer”:  dɤ̀š’ (S3: 32), dɤ̀ski (S4: 19), təkɤ̀f (S2: 81)
            Examples of “back nasal”:  sɤ̀deše (S1: 130), vɤ̀tre   (S2: 9)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/ (i.e. /ɤ/ with softening of the preceding consonant), though with certain exceptions.
            Examples of “front jer”: l’ɤ̀n (S2: 25), isp’ɤ̀niš (S2: 185) // tɤ̀vnutu (S4: 56), ispèniš (S2: 189)
            Examples of  “front nasal”: m’ɤ̀ku (S2: 12), gur’ɤ̀štətə (2: 51) // pr’eždə (S2: 58), z’èt’e (1: 195)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is also a basic Rhodope feature.
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /č’ɤr/.
            Example: č’ɤ̀rnite (S2: 121)
• The stressed vowel /o/ is sporadically pronounced as /wo/.
            Examples: prwòstə (3: 21), wògɤn’ (S3: 102)
• A prothetic /j/ occurs before stressed initial /e/.
            Example: jèlhə (S2: 99)
• There is frequent elision of unstressed vowels.
            Examples: vìtte (S1: 191), zìmme (S2: 55), sɛ̀k (S3: 25), t’èlve (S4: 14)
• Soft consonants may appear word-finally.
            Examples: nəzàt’ (S2: 180), icumèn’ (S3: 52), kàl’ (S4: 14)
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ word-initially, and to /vn/ intervocalically.
            Examples: mlògu (S2: 147), tɤ̀vnutu (S4: 56).
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: cìgənkìte (S2: 55), nìkugàš’ (S1: 89)
• The accent retracts in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: pòlə (S1: 193), jèlhə (S2: 99); d’ɛ̀te (S1: 180), plàtnu (S2: 10), dɤ̀rvu (S2: 185), vɤ̀že (S3: 26)
• The accent is retracted to initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Example: kɤ̀lnɤ (S1: 133)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative.
            Example: pr’èdi (S2: 128).
 
Morphology
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: kàmənete (S2: 70), trùp’e (S2: 3)
• The masculine singular definite article in nouns is /-ɤ/ after hard consonants and  /-e/
(or /-ɤ/) after soft ones.
            Examples: l’ənɤ̀ (S2: 10), cvetɤ̀ (S2: 83) // məž’ɤ̀ (S1: 22),  zèt’e (S1: 195), fəsùl’e (S3:90)
• The plural masculine definite article may be /-to/.
            Example: məž’ètu (S2: 122)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: gləvɤ̀tə (S3: 30), zem’ɤ̀tə (S3: 39)
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialect, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form).
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frèd (S2: 139)
• Passive participles are formed almost exclusively with the suffix /-t/.
            Examples: umàčkət (S2: 204), vɤ̀rzətù (S3: 32), utvòr’əti (S3: 151)
            Exception: umòkrenu (S3: 37)
• The use of neuter predicate forms has been generalized to include unspecified reference to human subjects.
            Examples: kòjtu e pò pɤ̀rgəvu (S3: 5), kəkvò si s’àlu, kvò si kupàlu (S3: 115).

"Stojkite","10387","Devin","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

"Stančov Han","10386","Trjavna","CENTRAL BALKAN -TRJAVNA
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the Central Balkan variety is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Trjavna. It is important to note that the overall Central Balkan group is quite diverse (even the principal unifying feature, the modern results of the historical vowel “jat”, shows variation from region to region). Due to organizational factors concerning the field expeditions which produced the data for the BDLT website, data was obtained only from the town of Trjavna (T) and four villages in its vicinity: Bangejci (B), Černovrŭh (Č), Prestoj (P) and Stančov Han (SH).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the speech of the Trjavna region. It is based on the speech of these five locales as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. P = Prestoj) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Bangejci 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” developed as in the standard language, namely /’a/ before hard syllables and /e/ before soft syllables. There two exceptions with respect to the standard language: the vowel /e/ appears in 1st and 2nd plural past tense forms, and word-finally in aorist forms.
            Examples: zəpr’èhme (B1: 86), b’èxmi (B2: 5), zəpustè (SH3: 9)
    In fact, these forms are regular if one applies the rule strictly: the standard forms are exceptional in displaying /’a/ before a soft syllable.
•  The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: tujàgətə (SH1: 9), təčàh (SH2: 7), venčàvət (Č: 19) // jèrenci (T: 178), tujègi (SH1: 7), təčèhmi (B2: 71), venčèjət (Č: 21)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ between postalveolar and labial consonants.
            Example: žuv’èi (B1: 26)
• The unstressed vowels /e/, /a/, /o/ are pronounced as /i/, /ə/, /u/, respectively; this is very close to what Bulgarian dialectologists call “full vowel reduction”. The pronunciation of unstressed /e/ as /’ə/ is relatively rare.
            Examples: vrit’ènutu (SH1: 58), mitɤ̀ (B1: 36) // grədɤ̀ (B1: 27), krəkàtə (SH1: 72) // udlip’ɤ̀d (P: 70), s’elu (B1: 7) // b’ed’ən (SH1: 14)
  In endings of the imperfect tense, however, /e/ remains unchanged.
            Examples: òd’exa (SH1: 5), rəbòt’exə̥ (SH1: 22), pràvea (B1: 49)
• The consonant /x/ is best preserved (sometimes shifted to /h/) in past tense verbal endings before a consonant. It is frequently lost in all other positions.
            Examples: b’exmi (B2: 5), zəpr’ehmi (B1:86) // òdea (B1: 82), r’èku (SH3: 41), ispupàsuə (T: 140)
    Sometimes this loss is compensated by a lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: isɤ̀:ni (B2: 43), duisɤ̀:ni (B2: 45)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: ìgli (B2: 55), dɤ̀ski (Č: 44)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunction “kato”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kəd gì izvìkəme (T: 150), kəd gì putklədɤ̀t (P: 16), kəd gì izbràxmi (SH3: 36)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/. 
            Examples: zim’ɤ̀ (B1: 69), gurɤ̀tə (Č: 23), vudɤ̀ (B2: 42)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.

"Široka Lŭka","10385","Devin","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

"Prestoj","10384","Trjavna","CENTRAL BALKAN -TRJAVNA
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the Central Balkan variety is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Trjavna. It is important to note that the overall Central Balkan group is quite diverse (even the principal unifying feature, the modern results of the historical vowel “jat”, shows variation from region to region). Due to organizational factors concerning the field expeditions which produced the data for the BDLT website, data was obtained only from the town of Trjavna (T) and four villages in its vicinity: Bangejci (B), Černovrŭh (Č), Prestoj (P) and Stančov Han (SH).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the speech of the Trjavna region. It is based on the speech of these five locales as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. P = Prestoj) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Bangejci 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” developed as in the standard language, namely /’a/ before hard syllables and /e/ before soft syllables. There two exceptions with respect to the standard language: the vowel /e/ appears in 1st and 2nd plural past tense forms, and word-finally in aorist forms.
            Examples: zəpr’èhme (B1: 86), b’èxmi (B2: 5), zəpustè (SH3: 9)
    In fact, these forms are regular if one applies the rule strictly: the standard forms are exceptional in displaying /’a/ before a soft syllable.
•  The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: tujàgətə (SH1: 9), təčàh (SH2: 7), venčàvət (Č: 19) // jèrenci (T: 178), tujègi (SH1: 7), təčèhmi (B2: 71), venčèjət (Č: 21)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ between postalveolar and labial consonants.
            Example: žuv’èi (B1: 26)
• The unstressed vowels /e/, /a/, /o/ are pronounced as /i/, /ə/, /u/, respectively; this is very close to what Bulgarian dialectologists call “full vowel reduction”. The pronunciation of unstressed /e/ as /’ə/ is relatively rare.
            Examples: vrit’ènutu (SH1: 58), mitɤ̀ (B1: 36) // grədɤ̀ (B1: 27), krəkàtə (SH1: 72) // udlip’ɤ̀d (P: 70), s’elu (B1: 7) // b’ed’ən (SH1: 14)
  In endings of the imperfect tense, however, /e/ remains unchanged.
            Examples: òd’exa (SH1: 5), rəbòt’exə̥ (SH1: 22), pràvea (B1: 49)
• The consonant /x/ is best preserved (sometimes shifted to /h/) in past tense verbal endings before a consonant. It is frequently lost in all other positions.
            Examples: b’exmi (B2: 5), zəpr’ehmi (B1:86) // òdea (B1: 82), r’èku (SH3: 41), ispupàsuə (T: 140)
    Sometimes this loss is compensated by a lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: isɤ̀:ni (B2: 43), duisɤ̀:ni (B2: 45)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: ìgli (B2: 55), dɤ̀ski (Č: 44)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunction “kato”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kəd gì izvìkəme (T: 150), kəd gì putklədɤ̀t (P: 16), kəd gì izbràxmi (SH3: 36)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/. 
            Examples: zim’ɤ̀ (B1: 69), gurɤ̀tə (Č: 23), vudɤ̀ (B2: 42)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.

"Petŭrnica","10383","Pleven","NORTHWESTERN: Bjala Slatina - Pleven
            The easternmost dialects within the larger region of Northwest Bulgarian dialects are known as the Bjala Slatina - Pleven dialect. This group is represented on the website by two villages: Gigen (G) and Petŭrnica (P). Maxim Mladenov (1993: 60, 180) made a subsequent division within this group, citing the nominative form of the first singular pronoun as the isogloss dividing them. He called the western group (with the pronoun ja, jaze) the Bjala Slatina dialect, and the eastern group (with the pronoun az) the Iskŭr-Vit dialect. Both the villages on this site belong to this latter eastern group. In addition, these two villages are characterized by an important feature that both binds them and marks them as different from the majority of the Northwestern region: the historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears as open /ɛ/, distinct from etymological /e/. This development is found in all stressed syllables regardless of the nature of the following syllable. This same feature is found in a relatively small number of villages scattered along the western periphery of the major line dividing all Bulgarian dialects according to the development of this vowel (the “jat” isogloss), all the way from the Danube in the far north to Pazardžik in the central south (Gorno Vŭršilo, also represented on this site) is another one of them). These villages do not differ in any other significant way from their immediate neighbors.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Bjala Slatina - Pleven dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. Because these two villages are not immediate neighbors, their dialects differ in a number of ways. We list first the features common to them, and then those that differentiate them.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village, if there is more than one (e.g. G1 = Gigen 1) or simply the village (P = Petǔrnica), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
COMMON FEATURES
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /ɛ/.
            Examples: dvɛ̀ (G1: 4), gulɛ̀m (G1: 8), dubrɛ̀ (P: 4), živɛ̀le (P: 1)
• Unstressed /o/ is occasionally replaced by /a/.
            Example: bìvale (P: 35)
• Soft  /l’/ is replaced by /j/.
            Examples: bɛ̀jek (P: 11), pojànata (P: 38)
• Soft /t’/ and /d’/ are replaced by /k’/ and /g’/.
            Example: bràk’e (P: 3)
 
Accent
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles.
            Example: skočìa (P: 25),
    This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Example: naràždaa (P: 3)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2nd conjugation verbs.
            Example: poizmòril (G2: 7)
 
Morphology
• The neuter plural formant /t/  is lost in definite forms:
            Example: momčèata (G2: 4)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is /-ɤ/ and when unstressed /-ə/, both of which are the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”.
            Examples: vujnɤ̀ (G1: 1), glavɤ̀ (P: 28)
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form).
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Example: žetvàre (G1: 9)
• The plural ending of the L-participle is /-e/.
            Example: fanàle (G1: 6)
• Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example: jàden’e (P: 51)
• The ending of 1st person plural present tense forms can be either /-me/ or /-m/.
            Examples: živɛ̀eme (P: 4), dɤržìm (P: 35), kopàem (G2: 20)
 
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
Phonology
• The consonant /x/ in verbal endings developed in different ways in the two villages. In Petǔrnica it was replaced by /j/ in final position and before a consonant, whereas in Gigen its loss was “compensated” by lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: dodòjme (P:6), nòsej (P: 37)  // kòse:me (G1: 10).
• The consonant /l/ in syllable-final position remained unchanged in Gigen, but in Petǔrnica it was lost and the preceding vowel was lengthened.
            Examples: poizmòril (G2:7) //  dovè: (P: 10), da:bòka (P: 21);  bì:  (P: 16)
 
Accent
• End stress in adjectives is recorded only in Petŭrnica.
            Examples: nemì (P: 29) // gul’èmi (G1: 4)
• Accent in prefixed first singular present tense forms is sometimes shifted to the initial syllable in Petŭrnica, though this is not consistent. It does not happen in Gigen.
            Examples: zàveda (P: 39) vs. poglèdna (P:14) //  [no relevant examples in Gigen]
 
Morphology
• The shape of the vowel in the plural article in Petǔrnica is either /i/ or /e/, whereas in Gigen the vowel is always pronounced somewhere between the two, as /e̝/. What is interesting is that in Petǔrnica the shape of the vowel in the article is determined by the preceding vowel (the final vowel of the noun in question).
            Examples: ezì̀citi (P: 22),  kon’ète (P: 37) //  kočànite̝ (G2: 22), ofcète̝ (G2: 27).
This is one of the few instances of “vowel harmony” in Bulgarian dialects.

"Hvojna","10382","Asenovgrad","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Hvojna
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            The dialect of Hvojna, also called the dialect of Ropkata, is spoken in a relatively small island within the Central/Smoljan Rhodope dialect, situated to the north of Smoljan. This dialectal “island” contains only five villages, three of which are represented on this site: Hvojna (H), Malevo (M) and Pavelsko (P). Despite its small size, however, it was accorded considerable importance by Miletich, who considered it to be the region where the “original ‘dark’ vowel” (the initial stage of the typical Rhodope merger of four important historical Slavic vowels) was actually preserved. (Miletich 1912: 29).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Hvojna dialect. It is based on the speech of the three villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. H1 = Hvojna 1, P2 = Pavelsko 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Asenovgrad region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Asg.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  follows a different pattern than in other dialects, where the modern vowel continuing it either always takes the same form, or alternates between two forms depending on the shape of the segment or syllable following it. Here, the vowel is /’a/  throughout all forms of a word if the conditions for /’a/  are present in any one form; if not, then it is /e/  in all forms of the word.
            Examples with /’a/:  gul’àm  (H2: 26), gul’àmi  (M1: 6), c’alija  (M2: 1), t’asni  (P4: 25)
            Examples with /e/ : m’èsec  (H2: 28), vr’ème  (H2: 15), ned’èl’e  (M2: 79)
     One may also find /’a/  in transparently related words.
            Example: kol’ance (M1: 6) [diminutive form of kol’ano]
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are s follows: in stressed syllables they appear as /ɛ/  after post-alveolar consonants, and as /a/  after /j/.
            Examples: č’ɛ̀k  (H1: 35), š’ɛ̀ren  (H1: 51), venč’ɛ̀vət  (H1: 52), š’ɛ̀və  (M1: 103) // jàli  (M1: 64), jàjca  (H1: 14)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/, with the phonetic variant /ʌ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
            Examples of back jer: dɤ̀skə  (H2: 6), dɤ̀š’  (P4: 97), mʌ̀knehme  (H2: 10)
            Examples of back nasal: fkʌ̀šti  (Ha: 31), pʌ̀t’  (M3: 55),
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal’ appear consistently in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, although all such words can also optionally occur with /e/. The consistency of this replacement is such that it embraces even the words for ‘day’ and ‘five’, which are exceptions elsewhere in the Rhodopes.
            Examples of front jer:  z’ʌ̀mət  (H1: 35), z’èmət  (H1: 34), l’ʌ̀snu  (M1: 73), l’èsno  (M1: 98)
            Examples of front nasal:  p’ʌ̀t  (H1: 4), jʌ̀dri  (P2: 21), jèdru  (H2: 22), l’ʌ̀štətə  (M1:18), l’èštətə  (H2: 5)
     As elsewhere in the Rhodopes, the merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers  and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a significant defining feature of their “Rhodope” affiliation. (Miletič 1912: 29).
      In this particular dialect the vowel /ɤ/ appears in the phonetic variant /ʌ/ after soft consonants (including post-alveolars) and also frequently after bilabial consonants and sometimes also after velar consonants.
• Early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɤr/  and /ɤl/  or /lɤ/.
            Examples: pʌ̀rs  (M1: 95), gʌ̀rp  (M1: 38), vʌ̀rbnicə  (P3: 13), gʌ̀rsnici  (P4: 85), nəpɤ̀l’nim  (M3: 50), slɤ̀nceno  (M3: 50)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Example:  trɤ̀sime  (M2: 12)  
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: rəmòt  (M3: 43), məgàrtə  (P4: 28)
• The vowel /o/  is frequently replaced by /wo/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: wòfce  (H1: 1), nwòsim  (P3: 14), nəwòkulu  (P1: 27)
• The consonant /x/  is replaced by /h/  in all positions, and frequently lost word-initially.
            Examples: pràvehə  (H1: 9), bèhme  (M1: 59), hòru  (M2: 77) // l’àp  (M1: 94), rànime  (M2: 65), òdehne  (M1: 37)
• Soft consonants can appear in word-final position.
            Examples: kupèn’  (H3: 4), uš’mèr’  (H1: 8), pʌ̀t’  ( H3: 55)
• The consonants /l/  and /n/  are palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: tɤ̀n’ki  (H2: 45), l’ùl’kite  (H1: 15)
• Fricative consonants are frequently replaced by affricates after liquids.
            Examples: dərdžì  (P2: 14), vɤ̀rdzuəme  (P2: 19)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft affricates /c’/  and /dz’/.
            Examples: c’ìkvi  ( P2: 25), puisc’ìne  (M2: 28), pusedz’ì  (P1: 24)
 
Accent
• There is occasional occurrence of double accent:
            Examples: zàguv’èznite  (H1: 13), nòzicìne ( M1: 104)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: dɤ̀skə  (H2: 6), kòsə  (M1: 4), vʌ̀rbə  (P3: 14), lìcetu  (H1: 45), m’ʌ̀su  (M2: 51), hòru  (M2: 77)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: nàtup’ə  (M3: 14), kòs’ə  (M2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperatives.
            Examples: mʌ̀kni  (M1: 5), pràj  (M3: 45)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: muzikànte  (M2: 80), snòpene  (M3: 53), š’iž’ìme  (P1: 33)
• The plural forms of the words for ‘arm’ and ‘leg’ have the productive ending -i  instead of the old dual ending /-e/.
            Examples: nògi  (P2: 19), rəkìse  (M3: 47)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
               Examples: vudɤ̀tə  (H2: 40), pl’evɤ̀  (P4: 75)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• A significant defining feature of Rhodope dialects is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: r’àkəsə  (M3: 15), màslutu  (H1: 7), kòn’uven’e  (M1: 16)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns. Unfortunately there are no examples of distal or proximal pronouns in these texts.
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà  (M2: 21)
            3rd singular accusative masculine n’ègə  (M2: 47)
            3rd singular dative feminine short form hi  (H1: 44)
            1st plural nominative  n’è  (P4: 102)
            3rd plural dative him  (H1: 52)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is lost in the definite form of masculine singular nouns.
            Examples: ògn’en  (M3: 31), bɤ̀klən  (M3: 54)
• The masculine definite form of adjectives can be formed from the bare stem.
            Examples: ədìnən  (P2: 14), drùgən  (P2: 14)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkvi ìmə tə resìč’ət snòpite  (M1: 70), n’akəf l’èf  (M2: 4)
• Verbs of all three conjugations have the same endings in 1st person singular present tense forms: /-m/  for unprefixed verbs and /-a/  for prefixed verbs.
            Examples: mɤ̀č’əm  (M2: 3), pràv’əm  (M2: 54), vòd’əm  (P4: 55), sl’èzəm  (M3: 15) // dòkərə  (P2: 14), prèkərə  (M2: 89)
• The future particle is še  in Pavelsko and že  or žə  in Hvojna and Malevo.
            Examples: še izduìm  (P2: 3), že tùriš  (M3: 35), žə vdìgə  (H3: 6)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Example: dušlòlu  (M3: 51)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/  is replaced by /a/  (pronounced /ə/  when unstressed).
            Examples: r’èkəh  (P2: 9), izl’èzəhə  (M2: 12)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of many verbs.
            Examples: ràdə  (H1: 39), pugàdət  (H1: 54), fàtəme  (P2: 18)

• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
               Examples: vudɤ̀tə  (H2: 40), pl’evɤ̀  (P4: 75)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• A significant defining feature of Rhodope dialects is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: r’àkəsə  (M3: 15), màslutu  (H1: 7), kòn’uven’e  (M1: 16)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns. Unfortunately there are no examples of distal or proximal pronouns in these texts.
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà  (M2: 21)
            3rd singular accusative masculine n’ègə  (M2: 47)
            3rd singular dative feminine short form hi  (H1: 44)
            1st plural nominative  n’è  (P4: 102)
            3rd plural dative him  (H1: 52)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is lost in the definite form of masculine singular nouns.
            Examples: ògn’en  (M3: 31), bɤ̀klən  (M3: 54)
• The masculine definite form of adjectives can be formed from the bare stem.
            Examples: ədìnən  (P2: 14), drùgən  (P2: 14)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkvi ìmə tə resìč’ət snòpite  (M1: 70), n’akəf l’èf  (M2: 4)
• Verbs of all three conjugations have the same endings in 1st person singular present tense forms: /-m/  for unprefixed verbs and /-a/  for prefixed verbs.
            Examples: mɤ̀č’əm  (M2: 3), pràv’əm  (M2: 54), vòd’əm  (P4: 55), sl’èzəm  (M3: 15) // dòkərə  (P2: 14), prèkərə  (M2: 89)
• The future particle is še  in Pavelsko and že  or žə  in Hvojna and Malevo.
            Examples: še izduìm  (P2: 3), že tùriš  (M3: 35), žə vdìgə  (H3: 6)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Example: dušlòlu  (M3: 51)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/  is replaced by /a/  (pronounced /ə/  when unstressed).
            Examples: r’èkəh  (P2: 9), izl’èzəhə  (M2: 12)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of many verbs.
            Examples: ràdə  (H1: 39), pugàdət  (H1: 54), fàtəme  (P2: 18)

"Momčilovci","10380","Smoljan","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

"Malevo/Asg","10379","Asenovgrad","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Hvojna
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            The dialect of Hvojna, also called the dialect of Ropkata, is spoken in a relatively small island within the Central/Smoljan Rhodope dialect, situated to the north of Smoljan. This dialectal “island” contains only five villages, three of which are represented on this site: Hvojna (H), Malevo (M) and Pavelsko (P). Despite its small size, however, it was accorded considerable importance by Miletich, who considered it to be the region where the “original ‘dark’ vowel” (the initial stage of the typical Rhodope merger of four important historical Slavic vowels) was actually preserved. (Miletich 1912: 29).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Hvojna dialect. It is based on the speech of the three villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. H1 = Hvojna 1, P2 = Pavelsko 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Asenovgrad region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Asg.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  follows a different pattern than in other dialects, where the modern vowel continuing it either always takes the same form, or alternates between two forms depending on the shape of the segment or syllable following it. Here, the vowel is /’a/  throughout all forms of a word if the conditions for /’a/  are present in any one form; if not, then it is /e/  in all forms of the word.
            Examples with /’a/:  gul’àm  (H2: 26), gul’àmi  (M1: 6), c’alija  (M2: 1), t’asni  (P4: 25)
            Examples with /e/ : m’èsec  (H2: 28), vr’ème  (H2: 15), ned’èl’e  (M2: 79)
     One may also find /’a/  in transparently related words.
            Example: kol’ance (M1: 6) [diminutive form of kol’ano]
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are s follows: in stressed syllables they appear as /ɛ/  after post-alveolar consonants, and as /a/  after /j/.
            Examples: č’ɛ̀k  (H1: 35), š’ɛ̀ren  (H1: 51), venč’ɛ̀vət  (H1: 52), š’ɛ̀və  (M1: 103) // jàli  (M1: 64), jàjca  (H1: 14)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/, with the phonetic variant /ʌ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
            Examples of back jer: dɤ̀skə  (H2: 6), dɤ̀š’  (P4: 97), mʌ̀knehme  (H2: 10)
            Examples of back nasal: fkʌ̀šti  (Ha: 31), pʌ̀t’  (M3: 55),
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal’ appear consistently in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, although all such words can also optionally occur with /e/. The consistency of this replacement is such that it embraces even the words for ‘day’ and ‘five’, which are exceptions elsewhere in the Rhodopes.
            Examples of front jer:  z’ʌ̀mət  (H1: 35), z’èmət  (H1: 34), l’ʌ̀snu  (M1: 73), l’èsno  (M1: 98)
            Examples of front nasal:  p’ʌ̀t  (H1: 4), jʌ̀dri  (P2: 21), jèdru  (H2: 22), l’ʌ̀štətə  (M1:18), l’èštətə  (H2: 5)
     As elsewhere in the Rhodopes, the merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers  and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a significant defining feature of their “Rhodope” affiliation. (Miletič 1912: 29).
      In this particular dialect the vowel /ɤ/ appears in the phonetic variant /ʌ/ after soft consonants (including post-alveolars) and also frequently after bilabial consonants and sometimes also after velar consonants.
• Early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɤr/  and /ɤl/  or /lɤ/.
            Examples: pʌ̀rs  (M1: 95), gʌ̀rp  (M1: 38), vʌ̀rbnicə  (P3: 13), gʌ̀rsnici  (P4: 85), nəpɤ̀l’nim  (M3: 50), slɤ̀nceno  (M3: 50)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Example:  trɤ̀sime  (M2: 12)  
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: rəmòt  (M3: 43), məgàrtə  (P4: 28)
• The vowel /o/  is frequently replaced by /wo/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: wòfce  (H1: 1), nwòsim  (P3: 14), nəwòkulu  (P1: 27)
• The consonant /x/  is replaced by /h/  in all positions, and frequently lost word-initially.
            Examples: pràvehə  (H1: 9), bèhme  (M1: 59), hòru  (M2: 77) // l’àp  (M1: 94), rànime  (M2: 65), òdehne  (M1: 37)
• Soft consonants can appear in word-final position.
            Examples: kupèn’  (H3: 4), uš’mèr’  (H1: 8), pʌ̀t’  ( H3: 55)
• The consonants /l/  and /n/  are palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: tɤ̀n’ki  (H2: 45), l’ùl’kite  (H1: 15)
• Fricative consonants are frequently replaced by affricates after liquids.
            Examples: dərdžì  (P2: 14), vɤ̀rdzuəme  (P2: 19)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft affricates /c’/  and /dz’/.
            Examples: c’ìkvi  ( P2: 25), puisc’ìne  (M2: 28), pusedz’ì  (P1: 24)
 
Accent
• There is occasional occurrence of double accent:
            Examples: zàguv’èznite  (H1: 13), nòzicìne ( M1: 104)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: dɤ̀skə  (H2: 6), kòsə  (M1: 4), vʌ̀rbə  (P3: 14), lìcetu  (H1: 45), m’ʌ̀su  (M2: 51), hòru  (M2: 77)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: nàtup’ə  (M3: 14), kòs’ə  (M2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperatives.
            Examples: mʌ̀kni  (M1: 5), pràj  (M3: 45)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: muzikànte  (M2: 80), snòpene  (M3: 53), š’iž’ìme  (P1: 33)
• The plural forms of the words for ‘arm’ and ‘leg’ have the productive ending -i  instead of the old dual ending /-e/.
            Examples: nògi  (P2: 19), rəkìse  (M3: 47)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
               Examples: vudɤ̀tə  (H2: 40), pl’evɤ̀  (P4: 75)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• A significant defining feature of Rhodope dialects is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: r’àkəsə  (M3: 15), màslutu  (H1: 7), kòn’uven’e  (M1: 16)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns. Unfortunately there are no examples of distal or proximal pronouns in these texts.
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà  (M2: 21)
            3rd singular accusative masculine n’ègə  (M2: 47)
            3rd singular dative feminine short form hi  (H1: 44)
            1st plural nominative  n’è  (P4: 102)
            3rd plural dative him  (H1: 52)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is lost in the definite form of masculine singular nouns.
            Examples: ògn’en  (M3: 31), bɤ̀klən  (M3: 54)
• The masculine definite form of adjectives can be formed from the bare stem.
            Examples: ədìnən  (P2: 14), drùgən  (P2: 14)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkvi ìmə tə resìč’ət snòpite  (M1: 70), n’akəf l’èf  (M2: 4)
• Verbs of all three conjugations have the same endings in 1st person singular present tense forms: /-m/  for unprefixed verbs and /-a/  for prefixed verbs.
            Examples: mɤ̀č’əm  (M2: 3), pràv’əm  (M2: 54), vòd’əm  (P4: 55), sl’èzəm  (M3: 15) // dòkərə  (P2: 14), prèkərə  (M2: 89)
• The future particle is še  in Pavelsko and že  or žə  in Hvojna and Malevo.
            Examples: še izduìm  (P2: 3), že tùriš  (M3: 35), žə vdìgə  (H3: 6)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Example: dušlòlu  (M3: 51)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/  is replaced by /a/  (pronounced /ə/  when unstressed).
            Examples: r’èkəh  (P2: 9), izl’èzəhə  (M2: 12)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of many verbs.
            Examples: ràdə  (H1: 39), pugàdət  (H1: 54), fàtəme  (P2: 18)

"Izgrev/Car","10378","Carevo","EASTERN RUPIC: Strandža
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Strandža dialect group, as it name suggests, is located in the Strandža mountain range in the far southeast, but it occupies only the area along the river Veleka (see Gorov 1962: 14 for a map indicating which villages speak the Strandža dialect). Because the region includes a number of other clearly distinct dialects, Bojadžiev prefers to use the term “Malko Tŭrnovo dialect” (Bojadžiev 1996). The name “Strandža dialect” is the most commonly used one, however.
            This dialect is represented on the website by four villages, Brŭšljan (B), Izgrev (I), Stoilovo (S), and Zabernovo (Z). The list below summarizes the salient features of the Strandža dialect. It is based on the speech of these four villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (e.g. Z = Zabernovo); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Brŭšljan 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Izgrev: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Izgrev described here is located in the Carovo region; on the website it is labeled Izgrev/Car.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ before hard syllables and as /ɛ/ before soft syllables (that is, as in the standard language except for the fact of the open /ɛ/); in word-final position it appears as /’a/. It is unique feature of Strandža that an initial soft syllable in the following word also acts as a trigger for the alternation.
            Examples: sn’àk (B1: 85), pəs’àh (B1: 2) // dv’à (B1: 19) // dv’à dərv’ètə (B3: 30), dv’ɛ̀ tri kràvi.
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears in stressed syllables regularly as /e/.
            Example: ž’ènət (B1: 35)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals” is absent).
            Examples: p’ètə (Z: 4), ž’ètvə (B3: 14)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ following a post-alveolar or labial consonant, and sometimes by /u/ before a labial consonant.
            č’ufč’ìe (B1: 34), ž’uvèjə (Z: 2) // pupèr (B1: 15)
• There is evidence, in the speech of one Brŭšljan informant, of what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift. The three stages of this shift are: (1) the vowel /ɛ/ (from historical “jat”) was raised to /e/; (2) etymological /e/ was raised to /e̝/; (3) the high vowel /i/ was retracted to /ɨ/. Examples of the three stages:
            (1): štèš’e (B2: 1), budèš’e (B2: 7)
            (2): gurè̝štu (B2: 1), n’è̝gu (B2: 6)
            (3): jedɨ̀n (B2: 7), sɨ̀čkit’e (B2: 4)

• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions; it is sometimes lost, without any apparent systemic rule. 
            Examples: hòru (I: 17), hrànime (I: 21), izmr’àhə (B1: 52) // òdiš (B4: 45), vɤ̀zduət (Z: 38), ìl’ədi (B4: 43)
• The lengthened soft consonants /n’:/, /l’:/, and /k’:/ appear in masculine plural forms; the first of these also appears in verbal nouns.
            Examples: klen’:ètu (B4: 35), kəvàl’:e (B4: 50), kòl’:e (B3: 25; Z: 9), prɤ̀k’:e (B3: 33; Z: 9), stuèn’:e (S: 7)
     This is one of the quite rare features that is particularly characteristic of the Strandža dialect.
• The voiced affricate /dž/ is replaced by the fricative /ž/.
            Examples: čurbəžìite (B3: 13), kəvəlžìjnicə (B4: 51), mežì (I: 10)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: pɤ̀t’ (B3: 8), ufc’àr’ (B1: 5), kənòpəl’ (I: 2), dərmòn’ (Z: 41)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: màl’ki (B4: 41), sìl’ni (B1: 86)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial stressed /a/.
            Example: jàgnetə (B1: 2)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: udenìcətə (B3: 9), biul’à (B1: 39)
• Soft /t’/ is replaced by soft /k’/.
            Example: prɤ̀k’:e (Z: 9)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: lìpətə (B4: 33), r’àkətə (B2: 3), mòmi (B4: 66), kòzi (B1: 82),    žènte (Z: 35) // bràšnu (B3: 80), òči (Z: 35)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the 1st person singular present tense form.
            Example: pòl’əm (I: 14)
• Past tense forms of the verb ‘to be’ are unaccented.
            Examples: beh (B1: 5), beše (I: 18)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/ or /-je/.
            Examples: prəmətàre (B4: 53), d’ulbène (S: 25), nihnitìrje (Z: 37)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: gurɤ̀tə (B3: 33), gləvɤ̀tə (S: 32)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns.

In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The definite article for masculine singular nouns is /-ɤt /when stressed and /-ət/ when unstressed.
            Examples: dəždɤ̀t (B1: 83) // g’òlət (B2: 3)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Eamples: kònetu (B3: 20), klen’:ètu (B4: 35), vɛ̀truvetu (B1: 78)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (B4: 7)
            3rd plural accusative short form: i (B1: 14)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (Z: 37)
• The ending for 1st person plural present tense is /-m/ or /-me/. In Brŭšljan the ending /-ne/ is used alongside these two.
            Examples: hrànime (I: 8), bàgrime (S: 6), cɛ̀pime (Z: 9), gr’ɛ̀em (B3: 5), udlɤ̀č’ime (B1: 15), duìme (B1: 15) // pràine (B1: 66),  kàrəne (B1: 89)
• The passive participles of some verbs are formed with the suffix /-n-/ instead of expected /-t-/.

"Stoilovo","10376","Malko Tŭrnovo","EASTERN RUPIC: Strandža
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Strandža dialect group, as it name suggests, is located in the Strandža mountain range in the far southeast, but it occupies only the area along the river Veleka (see Gorov 1962: 14 for a map indicating which villages speak the Strandža dialect). Because the region includes a number of other clearly distinct dialects, Bojadžiev prefers to use the term “Malko Tŭrnovo dialect” (Bojadžiev 1996). The name “Strandža dialect” is the most commonly used one, however.
            This dialect is represented on the website by four villages, Brŭšljan (B), Izgrev (I), Stoilovo (S), and Zabernovo (Z). The list below summarizes the salient features of the Strandža dialect. It is based on the speech of these four villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (e.g. Z = Zabernovo); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Brŭšljan 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Izgrev: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Izgrev described here is located in the Carovo region; on the website it is labeled Izgrev/Car.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ before hard syllables and as /ɛ/ before soft syllables (that is, as in the standard language except for the fact of the open /ɛ/); in word-final position it appears as /’a/. It is unique feature of Strandža that an initial soft syllable in the following word also acts as a trigger for the alternation.
            Examples: sn’àk (B1: 85), pəs’àh (B1: 2) // dv’à (B1: 19) // dv’à dərv’ètə (B3: 30), dv’ɛ̀ tri kràvi.
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears in stressed syllables regularly as /e/.
            Example: ž’ènət (B1: 35)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals” is absent).
            Examples: p’ètə (Z: 4), ž’ètvə (B3: 14)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ following a post-alveolar or labial consonant, and sometimes by /u/ before a labial consonant.
            č’ufč’ìe (B1: 34), ž’uvèjə (Z: 2) // pupèr (B1: 15)
• There is evidence, in the speech of one Brŭšljan informant, of what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift. The three stages of this shift are: (1) the vowel /ɛ/ (from historical “jat”) was raised to /e/; (2) etymological /e/ was raised to /e̝/; (3) the high vowel /i/ was retracted to /ɨ/. Examples of the three stages:
            (1): štèš’e (B2: 1), budèš’e (B2: 7)
            (2): gurè̝štu (B2: 1), n’è̝gu (B2: 6)
            (3): jedɨ̀n (B2: 7), sɨ̀čkit’e (B2: 4)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: fc’ɛ̀ti (B1: 98), kìselcite (B4: 25), ečmìk (B3: 3), žènte (Z: 35)
• The Proto-Slavic sequence /*tj/ appears as /št/ or /šč/.
            Examples: kɤ̀štite (S: 3), sr’ɛ̀štəne (B1: 10), sv’ɛ̀šči (S: 6), šč’à: (I: 2)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions; it is sometimes lost, without any apparent systemic rule. 
            Examples: hòru (I: 17), hrànime (I: 21), izmr’àhə (B1: 52) // òdiš (B4: 45), vɤ̀zduət (Z: 38), ìl’ədi (B4: 43)
• The lengthened soft consonants /n’:/, /l’:/, and /k’:/ appear in masculine plural forms; the first of these also appears in verbal nouns.
            Examples: klen’:ètu (B4: 35), kəvàl’:e (B4: 50), kòl’:e (B3: 25; Z: 9), prɤ̀k’:e (B3: 33; Z: 9), stuèn’:e (S: 7)
     This is one of the quite rare features that is particularly characteristic of the Strandža dialect.
• The voiced affricate /dž/ is replaced by the fricative /ž/.
            Examples: čurbəžìite (B3: 13), kəvəlžìjnicə (B4: 51), mežì (I: 10)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: pɤ̀t’ (B3: 8), ufc’àr’ (B1: 5), kənòpəl’ (I: 2), dərmòn’ (Z: 41)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: màl’ki (B4: 41), sìl’ni (B1: 86)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial stressed /a/.
            Example: jàgnetə (B1: 2)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: udenìcətə (B3: 9), biul’à (B1: 39)
• Soft /t’/ is replaced by soft /k’/.
            Example: prɤ̀k’:e (Z: 9)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: lìpətə (B4: 33), r’àkətə (B2: 3), mòmi (B4: 66), kòzi (B1: 82),    žènte (Z: 35) // bràšnu (B3: 80), òči (Z: 35)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the 1st person singular present tense form.
            Example: pòl’əm (I: 14)
• Past tense forms of the verb ‘to be’ are unaccented.
            Examples: beh (B1: 5), beše (I: 18)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/ or /-je/.
            Examples: prəmətàre (B4: 53), d’ulbène (S: 25), nihnitìrje (Z: 37)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: gurɤ̀tə (B3: 33), gləvɤ̀tə (S: 32)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The definite article for masculine singular nouns is /-ɤt /when stressed and /-ət/ when unstressed.
            Examples: dəždɤ̀t (B1: 83) // g’òlət (B2: 3)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Eamples: kònetu (B3: 20), klen’:ètu (B4: 35), vɛ̀truvetu (B1: 78)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (B4: 7)
            3rd plural accusative short form: i (B1: 14)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (Z: 37)
• The ending for 1st person plural present tense is /-m/ or /-me/. In Brŭšljan the ending /-ne/ is used alongside these two.
            Examples: hrànime (I: 8), bàgrime (S: 6), cɛ̀pime (Z: 9), gr’ɛ̀em (B3: 5), udlɤ̀č’ime (B1: 15), duìme (B1: 15) // pràine (B1: 66),  kàrəne (B1: 89)
• The passive participles of some verbs are formed with the suffix /-n-/ instead of expected /-t-/.
            Example: utrìenə (Z: 28)
• The future in the past is used to indicate habitual action in the past.
            Examples: št’a: uvɤ̀ršème (B3: 2), št’a zəs’ɛ̀eme (B3: 4), šč’à sə zberème (I: 2)
     This is the most unique feature of the Strandža dialect, and the one which makes it the most immediately recognizable.

"Graševo","10375","Velingrad","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Velingrad: transitional (Graševo / Sveta Petka)
            The name Velingrad, used here to refer to the three villages of Sǔrnica, Graševo and Sveta Petka, is not intended as a specific dialect group name. It is rather the name of the relevant administrative region, and is chosen here as a cover term for a number of reasons. The established term “Čepino dialects” refers to the general region, but none of the three villages on this site are among the seven named as part of Čepino in the classic source discussing this dialect (Miletič 1912: 8). When used as a geographical term, “Čepino” includes those original seven cited by Miletič plus two more, one of which is Sveta Petka (Čankov 1958: 499).  
            Linguistically, each of the three villages on the site is both close to the Čepino dialect, and distinct from it in particular ways. Although Graševo and Sveta Petka are geographically closer to the Čepino group, their dialects are less similar to it and in fact have a number of features connecting them with the Razlog-Babjak dialect group. By contrast, Sǔrnica is geographically further from the Čepino group, but has more dialectal features in common with it. The solution taken here, therefore, is to group all three under the administrative term Velingrad, but to describe Sǔrnica separately from Graševo and Sveta Petka.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the dialects of Graševo and Sveta Petka. It is based on the speech of those villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. G = Graševo) the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. SP1 = Sveta Petka 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat’” appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/ in Sveta Petka, whereas in Graševo it appears as /e/, except after /c/ where it is /a/.

"Gorno Vŭršilo","10374","Ixtiman","SOUTHWESTERN: Ihtiman
            The Ihtiman dialect is represented on this website by two villages, Gorno Vŭršilo (GV) and Belica (B), although strictly speaking only the first of these belongs directly to the Ihtiman group. The Belica dialect is considered to be transitional between the Panagjurište dialect and the Ihtiman dialect, with two major features connecting it to the former and only one to the latter (Mladenov 1966: 16). Since this latter feature (the current form of the historical Slavic vowel “jat”) is usually considered to be more important, Belica is here included in the Ihtiman group. In a way, in fact, both dialects are somewhat marginal, since Gorno Vŭršilo is one of only four villages (out of total of 24 belonging to Ihtiman dialect) in which the form of the historical “jat” vowel in stressed syllables is the open front vowel /ɛ/ (as in the villages on this site representing the Bjala Slatina - Pleven group).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Ihtiman dialect group. It is based on the speech of the above two villages, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. GV1 = Gorno Vŭršilo 1, B2 = Belica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears as /ɛ/ in Gorno Vŭršilo and as /e/ in Belica.
            Examples: lɛ̀te (GV1: 13), sɛ̀no (GV1: 2) // bèx (B1: 4), golèma (B1: 16)
     After the consonant /c/, it appears as /a/ in both villages.
            Examples: càla (GV1: 52), precàždaš (B3: 20)
• The historical sequence “ja”  (including the sequence “post-alveolar + a”) is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples: vejàčka (GV1: 9), tojàga (B3: 37) // čèkat (B1: 45), edè (B1: 59)
• Both the historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” merge into a single vowel; in many instances the historical Slavic vowel “front jer” joins them. The result of this merger is /a/ in Gorno Vǔršilo and /ɤ/ in Belica.
            Examples of “back jer”: časà (GV2: 5) // dɤ̀ski (B2: 144), vɤ̀nka (B2: 142)
            Examples of “back nasal: pàte (GV2: 3), sedàt (GV1: 17) // kɤ̀šti (B1: 17), mɤ̀š (B1: 32)
            Examples of  “front jer”: žàne:me (GV1: 6) // žɤ̀na (B1: 24);
     This is the major trait connecting Belica with the dialect of Panagjurište (and not Ihtiman).
• The historical Slavic “front nasal” appears as /ɤ/ after post-alveolar consonants, i.e. with the same result as the historical Slavic “back nasal” (this is usually termed “merger of nasals”).
            Examples: [no examples from GV] // žɤ̀tva (B1: 35)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged:
            Examples: nafṛ̀l’am (GV1: 26), vṛ̀va (GV1: 27), dṛ̀veni (B1: 52), napḷna (B3: 79), napḷ̀nila (B3: 81)
• The consonant /x/ is preserved word-finally and lost in other positions. When it is lost before consonant, the preceding vowel is lengthened.
            Examples: zaprèx (GV1: 20), bèx (b1: 4), tèx (B1: 128), dokàraa (GV1: 17) // kòpa:me (GV1: 6), potkarvà:me (B1: 102)
• Intervocalic /j/ is lost in Belica but preserved in Gorno Vŭršilo.
            Examples: veàčki (B2: 52), nàsea (B2: 72) // vejàčka (GV1: 9)
• Voicing is retained in the preposition /v/.
            Examples: v ihtimàn (GV2: 22), v armàna (B2: 30)
• There is a schwa-like release of final consonants as a marker of an unfinished phrase.
            Examples: grùkə (B2: 40), ovèsə (B2: 99), smɛ̀xə (GV2: 6), kòpamə (GV2: 8)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: vṛ̀va (GV1: 27), zàmesa (GV1: 27), òra (B1: 25), òbṛza (B2: 71)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present tense of many 2nd conjugation verbs.
            Examples: sàdim (GV2: 62), ogràdim (B2: 25), ulòvim (B2: 29)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles.
            Examples: žɤnà (B1: 55), ranì:me (GV2: 42), vadìla (GV1: 2), gledàla (B1: 22)
     This shift does not occur if the verb form has a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: ožènixme (GV2: 37), presèlia (B1: 5), zarèza:me (B1: 104)
 
Morphology
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: kàmene (GV1: 42), tràktore (GV1: 11), čuvàle (B2: 112), samùne (B2: 116)
• The form of the masculine singular definite article in nouns is /-ɤ/ in Belica, and alternates between /-a/ and /-e/ (depending on the nature of the preceding consonant) in Gorno Vŭršilo.
            Examples: studɤ̀ (B2: 87) // lɛ̀ba (GV1: 13), pàte (GV2: 3)  
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”. In Belica this is /ɤ/, and in Gorno Vǔršilo it is /a/.
            Examples: branɤ̀ (B2: 82), dɤskɤ̀ (B2: 126) // stranà (GV 2: 53)
      These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialect, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form). Of course, when the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal” is /a/ (as in GV), there is no way to differentiate the two results.
• Verbs of the 2nd conjugation have hard consonants preceding the endings of 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense forms.
            Examples: pèčela (B1: 19), zàmesa (GV1: 26) // rèdat  (B2: 149), napḷ̀nat (GV 1:30)
• The future particle in B is šta for 1st person singular and šte (or še) elswhere; in GV it is consistently še.
            Examples: šta lìsna (B3: 83), šte mi vṛ̀zva (B1: 129), šte go jadè (B2: 58) // še ìde (GV 2: 34)
• The plural ending of L-participles is /-e/.
            Examples: gledàle (GV2: 66), otišlè (B1: 89), turìle (B2: 126)

"Stikŭl","10373","Devin","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

The complex dialectal variation of Bulgarian is best described within three major categories; the detailed description below follows this outline.
       The rubric Phonology describes the sound system of a dialect. Because the current forms (""reflexes"") of historical Slavic vowels divide the region so systematically, they are used as cover symbols for current lexical distribution of these sounds.
       The rubric Accent notes systematic differences in accent placement from the standard language; these are usually associated with grammatically-defined groups.
       The rubric Morphology describes features of nouns, pronouns and verbs that differ from the standard language in particularly noteworthy ways.

"Gela","10372","Devin","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

"Čokmanovo","10371","Smoljan","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

"Černovrŭx","10370","Trjavna","CENTRAL BALKAN -TRJAVNA
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the Central Balkan variety is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Trjavna. It is important to note that the overall Central Balkan group is quite diverse (even the principal unifying feature, the modern results of the historical vowel “jat”, shows variation from region to region). Due to organizational factors concerning the field expeditions which produced the data for the BDLT website, data was obtained only from the town of Trjavna (T) and four villages in its vicinity: Bangejci (B), Černovrŭh (Č), Prestoj (P) and Stančov Han (SH).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the speech of the Trjavna region. It is based on the speech of these five locales as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. P = Prestoj) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Bangejci 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” developed as in the standard language, namely /’a/ before hard syllables and /e/ before soft syllables. There two exceptions with respect to the standard language: the vowel /e/ appears in 1st and 2nd plural past tense forms, and word-finally in aorist forms.
            Examples: zəpr’èhme (B1: 86), b’èxmi (B2: 5), zəpustè (SH3: 9)
    In fact, these forms are regular if one applies the rule strictly: the standard forms are exceptional in displaying /’a/ before a soft syllable.
•  The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: tujàgətə (SH1: 9), təčàh (SH2: 7), venčàvət (Č: 19) // jèrenci (T: 178), tujègi (SH1: 7), təčèhmi (B2: 71), venčèjət (Č: 21)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ between postalveolar and labial consonants.
            Example: žuv’èi (B1: 26)
• The unstressed vowels /e/, /a/, /o/ are pronounced as /i/, /ə/, /u/, respectively; this is very close to what Bulgarian dialectologists call “full vowel reduction”. The pronunciation of unstressed /e/ as /’ə/ is relatively rare.
            Examples: vrit’ènutu (SH1: 58), mitɤ̀ (B1: 36) // grədɤ̀ (B1: 27), krəkàtə (SH1: 72) // udlip’ɤ̀d (P: 70), s’elu (B1: 7) // b’ed’ən (SH1: 14)
  In endings of the imperfect tense, however, /e/ remains unchanged.
            Examples: òd’exa (SH1: 5), rəbòt’exə̥ (SH1: 22), pràvea (B1: 49)
• The consonant /x/ is best preserved (sometimes shifted to /h/) in past tense verbal endings before a consonant. It is frequently lost in all other positions.
            Examples: b’exmi (B2: 5), zəpr’ehmi (B1:86) // òdea (B1: 82), r’èku (SH3: 41), ispupàsuə (T: 140)
    Sometimes this loss is compensated by a lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: isɤ̀:ni (B2: 43), duisɤ̀:ni (B2: 45)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: ìgli (B2: 55), dɤ̀ski (Č: 44)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunction “kato”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kəd gì izvìkəme (T: 150), kəd gì putklədɤ̀t (P: 16), kəd gì izbràxmi (SH3: 36)

    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.

"Brŭšljan","10369","Malko Tŭrnovo","EASTERN RUPIC: Strandža
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Strandža dialect group, as it name suggests, is located in the Strandža mountain range in the far southeast, but it occupies only the area along the river Veleka (see Gorov 1962: 14 for a map indicating which villages speak the Strandža dialect). Because the region includes a number of other clearly distinct dialects, Bojadžiev prefers to use the term “Malko Tŭrnovo dialect” (Bojadžiev 1996). The name “Strandža dialect” is the most commonly used one, however.
            This dialect is represented on the website by four villages, Brŭšljan (B), Izgrev (I), Stoilovo (S), and Zabernovo (Z). The list below summarizes the salient features of the Strandža dialect. It is based on the speech of these four villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (e.g. Z = Zabernovo); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Brŭšljan 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Izgrev: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Izgrev described here is located in the Carovo region; on the website it is labeled Izgrev/Car.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ before hard syllables and as /ɛ/ before soft syllables (that is, as in the standard language except for the fact of the open /ɛ/); in word-final position it appears as /’a/. It is unique feature of Strandža that an initial soft syllable in the following word also acts as a trigger for the alternation.
            Examples: sn’àk (B1: 85), pəs’àh (B1: 2) // dv’à (B1: 19) // dv’à dərv’ètə (B3: 30), dv’ɛ̀ tri kràvi.
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears in stressed syllables regularly as /e/.
            Example: ž’ènət (B1: 35)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals” is absent).
            Examples: p’ètə (Z: 4), ž’ètvə (B3: 14)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ following a post-alveolar or labial consonant, and sometimes by /u/ before a labial consonant.
            č’ufč’ìe (B1: 34), ž’uvèjə (Z: 2) // pupèr (B1: 15)
• There is evidence, in the speech of one Brŭšljan informant, of what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift. The three stages of this shift are: (1) the vowel /ɛ/ (from historical “jat”) was raised to /e/; (2) etymological /e/ was raised to /e̝/; (3) the high vowel /i/ was retracted to /ɨ/. Examples of the three stages:
            (1): štèš’e (B2: 1), budèš’e (B2: 7)
            (2): gurè̝štu (B2: 1), n’è̝gu (B2: 6)
            (3): jedɨ̀n (B2: 7), sɨ̀čkit’e (B2: 4)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: fc’ɛ̀ti (B1: 98), kìselcite (B4: 25), ečmìk (B3: 3), žènte (Z: 35)
• The Proto-Slavic sequence /*tj/ appears as /št/ or /šč/.
            Examples: kɤ̀štite (S: 3), sr’ɛ̀štəne (B1: 10), sv’ɛ̀šči (S: 6), šč’à: (I: 2)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions; it is sometimes lost, without any apparent systemic rule. 
            Examples: hòru (I: 17), hrànime (I: 21), izmr’àhə (B1: 52) // òdiš (B4: 45), vɤ̀zduət (Z: 38), ìl’ədi (B4: 43)
• The lengthened soft consonants /n’:/, /l’:/, and /k’:/ appear in masculine plural forms; the first of these also appears in verbal nouns.
            Examples: klen’:ètu (B4: 35), kəvàl’:e (B4: 50), kòl’:e (B3: 25; Z: 9), prɤ̀k’:e (B3: 33; Z: 9), stuèn’:e (S: 7)
     This is one of the quite rare features that is particularly characteristic of the Strandža dialect.
• The voiced affricate /dž/ is replaced by the fricative /ž/.
            Examples: čurbəžìite (B3: 13), kəvəlžìjnicə (B4: 51), mežì (I: 10)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: pɤ̀t’ (B3: 8), ufc’àr’ (B1: 5), kənòpəl’ (I: 2), dərmòn’ (Z: 41)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: màl’ki (B4: 41), sìl’ni (B1: 86)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial stressed /a/.
            Example: jàgnetə (B1: 2)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: udenìcətə (B3: 9), biul’à (B1: 39)
• Soft /t’/ is replaced by soft /k’/.
            Example: prɤ̀k’:e (Z: 9)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: lìpətə (B4: 33), r’àkətə (B2: 3), mòmi (B4: 66), kòzi (B1: 82),    žènte (Z: 35) // bràšnu (B3: 80), òči (Z: 35)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the 1st person singular present tense form.
            Example: pòl’əm (I: 14)
• Past tense forms of the verb ‘to be’ are unaccented.
            Examples: beh (B1: 5), beše (I: 18)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/ or /-je/.
            Examples: prəmətàre (B4: 53), d’ulbène (S: 25), nihnitìrje (Z: 37)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: gurɤ̀tə (B3: 33), gləvɤ̀tə (S: 32)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The definite article for masculine singular nouns is /-ɤt /when stressed and /-ət/ when unstressed.
            Examples: dəždɤ̀t (B1: 83) // g’òlət (B2: 3)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Eamples: kònetu (B3: 20), klen’:ètu (B4: 35), vɛ̀truvetu (B1: 78)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (B4: 7)
            3rd plural accusative short form: i (B1: 14)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (Z: 37)
• The ending for 1st person plural present tense is /-m/ or /-me/. In Brŭšljan the ending /-ne/ is used alongside these two.
            Examples: hrànime (I: 8), bàgrime (S: 6), cɛ̀pime (Z: 9), gr’ɛ̀em (B3: 5), udlɤ̀č’ime (B1: 15), duìme (B1: 15) // pràine (B1: 66),  kàrəne (B1: 89)
• The passive participles of some verbs are formed with the suffix /-n-/ instead of expected /-t-/.
            Example: utrìenə (Z: 28)
• The future in the past is used to indicate habitual action in the past.
            Examples: št’a: uvɤ̀ršème (B3: 2), št’a zəs’ɛ̀eme (B3: 4), šč’à sə zberème (I: 2)
     This is the most unique feature of the Strandža dialect, and the one which makes it the most immediately recognizable.

"Bangejci","10368","Trjavna","CENTRAL BALKAN -TRJAVNA
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the Central Balkan variety is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Trjavna. It is important to note that the overall Central Balkan group is quite diverse (even the principal unifying feature, the modern results of the historical vowel “jat”, shows variation from region to region). Due to organizational factors concerning the field expeditions which produced the data for the BDLT website, data was obtained only from the town of Trjavna (T) and four villages in its vicinity: Bangejci (B), Černovrŭh (Č), Prestoj (P) and Stančov Han (SH).
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the speech of the Trjavna region. It is based on the speech of these five locales as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. P = Prestoj) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. B1 = Bangejci 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” developed as in the standard language, namely /’a/ before hard syllables and /e/ before soft syllables. There two exceptions with respect to the standard language: the vowel /e/ appears in 1st and 2nd plural past tense forms, and word-finally in aorist forms.
            Examples: zəpr’èhme (B1: 86), b’èxmi (B2: 5), zəpustè (SH3: 9)
    In fact, these forms are regular if one applies the rule strictly: the standard forms are exceptional in displaying /’a/ before a soft syllable.
•  The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: tujàgətə (SH1: 9), təčàh (SH2: 7), venčàvət (Č: 19) // jèrenci (T: 178), tujègi (SH1: 7), təčèhmi (B2: 71), venčèjət (Č: 21)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ between postalveolar and labial consonants.
            Example: žuv’èi (B1: 26)
• The unstressed vowels /e/, /a/, /o/ are pronounced as /i/, /ə/, /u/, respectively; this is very close to what Bulgarian dialectologists call “full vowel reduction”. The pronunciation of unstressed /e/ as /’ə/ is relatively rare.
            Examples: vrit’ènutu (SH1: 58), mitɤ̀ (B1: 36) // grədɤ̀ (B1: 27), krəkàtə (SH1: 72) // udlip’ɤ̀d (P: 70), s’elu (B1: 7) // b’ed’ən (SH1: 14)
  In endings of the imperfect tense, however, /e/ remains unchanged.
            Examples: òd’exa (SH1: 5), rəbòt’exə̥ (SH1: 22), pràvea (B1: 49)
• The consonant /x/ is best preserved (sometimes shifted to /h/) in past tense verbal endings before a consonant. It is frequently lost in all other positions.
            Examples: b’exmi (B2: 5), zəpr’ehmi (B1:86) // òdea (B1: 82), r’èku (SH3: 41), ispupàsuə (T: 140)
    Sometimes this loss is compensated by a lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: isɤ̀:ni (B2: 43), duisɤ̀:ni (B2: 45)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of some disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: ìgli (B2: 55), dɤ̀ski (Č: 44)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunction “kato”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kəd gì izvìkəme (T: 150), kəd gì putklədɤ̀t (P: 16), kəd gì izbràxmi (SH3: 36)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/. 
            Examples: zim’ɤ̀ (B1: 69), gurɤ̀tə (Č: 23), vudɤ̀ (B2: 42)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.

"Vŭglarovo","10020","Xaskovo","EASTERN RUPIC: Thrace
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Thracian dialect group as such is not completely coterminous with the geographical region called Thrace; at the same time parts of the eastern Rhodopes are within this group. Thracian dialects are spoken in the valley of the river Marica and to the south of it, and to the northeast of it in the direction of Burgas. There are two sub-groups, northern and southern, which are separated by the river Arda (Bojadžiev 1991: 33). The northern group is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Haskovo: Kralevo (K), Malevo (M), Stalevo (S), Vŭglarovo (V). The southern group is represented by two villages from the region of Ivajlovgrad, Drabishna (D) and Huhla (H). Because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Thracian dialect. It is based on the speech of the six villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kralevo 1, D2 = Drabišna 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Haskovo region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Hsk.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears regularly as /e/.
            Examples: t’ènku (H2: 105; S4: 56), žènəlu (M1: 192), dl’ègi (K1: 47)
• The historical Slavic nasal vowels appear as in the standard language: /ɤ/ for the back nasal and /e/ for the front nasal, including after post-alveolar consonants. The only exception (the only evidence of the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals”) is the word for ‘handful’.
            Examples for back nasal: pɤ̀ti (H5: 25), rɤ̀kə (V2: 44)
            Examples for front nasal: ž’ètvə (D4: 4, M1: 184), š’ètəm (H2: 43) //: šɤ̀pkə (D2: 13)
      Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and the historical sequences and “post-alveolar + a”. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. The change is especially common after post-alveolar consonants.

• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dòrə (D2: 138), tòjtu (H3: 51), duòl’ni (K1: 11), utòri (S1: 169), òlvet (V2: 38)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: pànnələ (D2: 162), nəpànnəli (K3: 63), s’è̝nnem (V2: 127)

Morphology
• The masculine plural ending is /-e/.
            Examples: kòkəle (D2: 177), prof’èsure (K2: 83), dòkture (S2: 11)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: udɤ̀tə (D1: 84), vujnɤ̀ (H6: 62), žinɤ̀tə (K1: 18), gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for “arm” and “leg” is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rəkìti (M2: 39), nugì (H3: 47)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Examples: səjvànetu (D1: 84), kəlàmetu̥ (S1: 112), òluvetu (V2: 98), ubòretu (H3: 34)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (K1: 16), jàs (D1: 39); the first form is more frequent.
            3rd singular nominative neuter: tòj (D2: 72, K2: 74)
            3rd singular accusative masculine: n’ègə (K3: 43)
            3rd singular accusative feminine: nèhi (S4: 48)
            3rd plural accusative short form: hi (D1: 93), i (D2: 57)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (M1: 113), hni (S4: 40)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Examples: sòo (D1: 50), svà (K1: 2), tvà (S1: 117, D1: 4; K3: 8), nvà (H3: 52)
• The pronoun “kakǔv” and its derivatives are used instead of “koj” in adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkəv dèn’ (H3: 31), n’àkəf pɤ̀t (K2: 92; M1: 190), n’àkəv drɤ̀n (S3: 31)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: s’àkutri (H5: 41)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frɤ̀t (D2: 67)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dun’èsəh (D2: 13), fl’àzəhme (K1: 2), p’è̝kəh (V1: 123)
• The present stem is used in the aorist forms and L-participles of some verbs.
            Examples: zberàh (H3: 35), səberàl (K3: 50)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Example: plàtəne (H6: 26), izvàdəš (K2: 78), hàtəme (M1: 158), s’àtəhme (S4: 34)
• Secondary imperfective forms of certain verbs end in -icam instead of expected -ičam.
            Example: ublìcəli (S4: 47)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: dušlìli (H2: 63, D2: 7), reklìli (K3: 40)
• The future particle is zə in all villages except Huhla, where it is še.
            Examples: zə (D1: 42, K1: 3, M2: 4, S1: 4, V1: 28) // še (H6: 93)
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
     Both the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and etymological “ja” behave differently in the two subgroups.
•  Historical Slavic “jat”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group, it always appears as /’a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group it appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/, depending on the nature of the following syllable (that is, as in the standard language), except in aorist verb endings, where it is /e/.
            Examples: s’àme (D1: 42), gul’àmijə (H5: 11) // b’àhə (K1: 40), d’àdu (S4: 33), bèše (K1: 12).
            Example of aorist form: umr’è (M1: 54)
   Within the northern group, the front vowel that appears before palatalizing environment takes different phonetic forms. It is the open vowel /ɛ/ in Stalevo (though sometimes also /e/), but is raised to the more closed vowel /e̝/ in the other villages.
            Examples: : sm’ɛ̀n’əš (S1: 173), p’ɛ̀j (S1: 146) //  jədèše (S2: 73) // pusè̝iš (K1: 84)
    Finally, “jat” appears as /a/ after the /c/ in both the northern and southern groups.
            Examples: càl’ (H1: 81; M1: 192; V2: 14)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group these always appear as /a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group they appear   either as the back vowel /a/ or the open front vowel /ɛ/ depending on the nature of the following syllable (except after /j/, where the result is always /a/).
            Examples: teč’àš’e (D1: 84), uč’àhne (H2: 78) // issušàvə (S2: 51), nədnič’ɛret (M1: 184), uvəž’ɛvəhə (M1: 34), dərž’ɛ̀vi (S2: 88) // jàdenetu (M1: 113), vijàl’ki (M1: 238)
• The northern (Haskovo) group presents an interesting set of changes implementing what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift.
      First, the vowel /e/ is frequently raised to /e̝/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: sè̝lu (K1: 19), b’è̝hme (S1: 70), dvè̝ (V2: 34)
      Second, the high vowel /i/ is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: burɨ̀lu (K2: 77), vərtɨ̀ (M1: 233), bərdɨ̀lu (S1: 143), ugurɨ̀š (V1: 120)
      This chain shift continued, but only in Stalevo, with an occasional retraction of /ɤ/ to /ʌ/.
            Examples: gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3), jədʌ̀t (S2: 3)
 
Morphology
        The following traits are characteristic of the southern (Ivajlovgrad) dialect group.
• The 1st person plural ending /-ne/ for all tenses.
            Examples: klàvəne (D1: 49), glubine (H2: 64) // hrànehne (D1: 49), b’àhne (H6: 32) // stòrihne (H6: 30)
• Instances, albeit infrequent, of 1st person singular present tense endings characteristic of Rhodope dialects, namely /-m/ in verbs of the 1st and 2nd conjugations, and /-a/ in prefixed verbs of the 3rd conjugation.
            Examples: trɤ̀s’em (D2: 68), č’ètəm (H2: 67) // zàčukə (H6: 56)
• The future-in-the-past tense is formed with the future particle and the imperfect form of the verb.
            Example: še ìməše (H3: 46)

"Oreše","10019","Goce Delčev","WESTERN RUPIC: Čeč (Godeševo, Kruševo, Oreše)
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the westernmost portion of Rupic includes a number of quite distinct dialect groups, among which is the “Čeč dialect”. This dialect is represented on this site by three villages, Kruševo, Oreše, and Godeševo. According to the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/), all three are constituent members of this group. All three belong to the administrative region of Goce Delčev and all three are located relatively close to the town of Goce Delčev. Linguistically, however, they are quite distinct from the dialect of Goce Delčev, both as described in the classical work of Kiril Mirčev (Mirčev 1936) and as exemplified by the village Kovačevo on this website. It is therefore correct to place them in the Čeč dialect group rather than the Goce Delčev one.
            There are also significant differences within the Čeč group between the dialect of Godeševo on the one hand and that of Kruševo and Oreše on the other: the former shares a number of traits with Rhodope dialects whereas the latter are transitional between the Čeč and Goce Delčev dialect groups. Nevertheless, because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the dialect of Godeševo, Kruševo and Oreše. It is based on the speech of these three village as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above (O = Oreše); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kruševo 1, G2 = Godeševo 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /o/.
            Example of “back jer”:  čəsò (G1: 9), dòš’ (K1: 2), zəsòhnələ (K1: 73), kəkòf (K3: 86)
            Examples of “back nasal”:  ukòpiš (G2: 2), ležòd (G1: 8) kòštə (K1: 100), ispredòt (K1: 111)
   This is one of the major differentiating traits between the Čeč dialect, and that of Goce Delčev (where it appears as /ɤ/).
     Note: Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat”, front nasal and front jer. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cɤr/.
            Examples: cɤ̀rnətə (K3: 164), pucɤrven’èe (K4: 52) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The vowel /o/ is pronounced as /wo/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: rəbwòtime (G1: 6), pwòčvəme (G1: 7), wòt (K1: 39), wòsem (O: 20), wògən (O: 50)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial /a/.
            Examples: jàz (K1: 98), jàgn’e (K4: 68),  jà (G4: 18)
• There is frequent loss of unstressed vowels.
            Examples: guv’òttə (G1: 19), tvà (G1: 20), dùm (K1: 55), dvàdəj (K1: 60), kul’èntu (K3: 50)
• The consonant /x/ is lost in most positions.
            Examples: òrətə (K1: 29), snaìte (K1: 60), òrei (K3: 81), òdime (G3: 10), ərmàn (G3: 10), t’à (G3: 3),
• In verbal endings for past tenses, /x/ is lost intervocalically, replaced by /f/ word-finally, and lost or replaced by /f/ (and rarely by /v/) before another consonant.
            Examples of intervocalic /x/: utkàrəà jə (K1: 28)
            Examples of word-final /x/: l’ekuvəf (2: 43), iskàrəf (K1: 6) 
            Examples of /x/ before consonant: utìdəme (K1: 6), pràfme (K3: 42), bèvme (O: 34), kə̀wpifmè (G3: 17)
• There is anticipation of softness.
            Example: vèjke (K4: 11) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• Soft consonants may appear word-finally.
            Examples: fəsùl’ (G1: 7), càl’ (G2: 4), živòt’ (O:8), gòsput’ (O: 55), berekèt’ (K4: 118), kumpìr’ (K4: 83)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Example: s’ènnə (K3: 175), [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ word-initially and to /vn/ elsewhere.
            Examples: mlògu (K1: 43), pòvni (K1: 85), t’èvnu (K4: 13),  zəpòvnili (G3: 4)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: zəmòrknuvà li (G1: 16), dubìtəkà gu (G4: 16), pudgòt’uvàme (K1: 7), ìskaràm (K1: 9), iskàzuvàn’etu̥ (O: 60)
• The accent is frequently retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Example: Examples: vòdə (K3: 155), r’èkətə (K4: 109), žèni (K1: 62) // m’èsu (K4: 28), d’ètetu (K2: 12), d’àtetu (G2: 2)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: pòkəžə (K3: 21), òdnesàm (K21: 59) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative.
            Examples: dònesi (K1: 16), kùtni (K3: 131) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
 
Morphology
 • The plural ending for the feminine nouns rɤka  ‘arm’ and noga  ‘leg’ is /-i/, rather than the ending /-e/ (a continuation of the old dual ending, found in the standard language and many dialects).
            Examples: rəkə̀jte (G3: 11), nugìte (G1: 9), nògi (K3: 133)
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ərgàte (K4: 59), burkàne (K4: 114), pərcàl’e (G2: 4)
• The definite article for masculine nouns is /-o/ if stressed and /-ə/ if unstressed.
            Examples: stanò (K3: 18), čəsò (K4: 18, G1: 9) // kəzàn’ə (K3: 158)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is /-o/, which is the result of the the historical Slavic “back nasal”.
            Example: zem’òtə (O: 41) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
      Such forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form).
• The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà (K1: 9), jàz (K1: 98), jà (G4: 18)
            1st plural nominative n’è (O: 43)
            3rd plural dative short form mi (K1: 44)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: sàa pròl’et (K3: 158), sàə (G3: 20) // tvà (G1: 10)
• The ending of 1st person plural present tense forms for prefixed verbs of all conjugations is either /-m/ or /-a/ (unstressed /-ə/); for unprefixed verbs it is always /-a/ if stressed and /-ə/ if unstressed.
            Examples: ìskaràm (K1: 9), òdnesàm (K1: 59) // òdnesə (K1: 56), ìzberə (K1: 55) // pràv’ə (K1: 61), žìv’ə (K1: 102), stòpl’ə (K2: 29) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Example: dòjdəhme (K3: 163) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• Intransitive verbs can be used transitively.
            Example: še gi nəl’àgəme (G1: 8)  [no examples in Kruševo or Oreše texts]
• Only the pronoun kakɤv and its derivatives are used with adjectival function, and never the pronoun koj.
            Example: nèkvi žèni (K12: 62) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frèt (K4: 79) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
The historical Slavic vowels “jat”, front nasal, and front “jer”, and the sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” behave differently in the two subgroups.
• Historical Slavic “jat”. It appears in stressed syllables as /e/ in Kruševo and Oreše, but as /’a/ in Godeševo. In both regions it appears as /a/ after the consonant /c/.
            Examples: m’èsec (K2: 10), izl’èlu (K1: 97), uts’èkəde (K1: 43) // s’ànkətə (G1: 15), d’àtetu (G2: 2), gul’àmi (G2: 8) // càl’ (K2: 10)
    This is one of the traits differentiating Čec from the dialect of Goce Delčev, where it appears as in the standard language.
• Historical Slavic front nasal and front “jer”. In Kruševo and Oreše these appear in stressed syllables as /e/ (with the front jer sometimes as /ɤ/), while in Godeševo they appear as /’o/ (i.e. /o/ with softening of the preceding consonant), though with certain exceptions.
            Example of “front jer”: tèničku (K1: 42), t’èvnu (K4: 13) / ž’ɤ̀neme (K4: 13) // ž’òneš (G1: 14) / dèn (G2: 4)
            Examples of  “front nasal”: izgl’èdələ (K1: 27), m’èsu (K4: 28), odm’èkne (K4: 47) // guv’òttə (G1: 19), izgl’òdəli (G2: 7)
    The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a basic Rhodope feature, and one of the primary features differentiating the dialect of Godeševo from that of Kruševo and Oreše.
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In Kruševo and Oreše they appear as /a/ after /j/, and as /ɛ/ after post-alveolar consonants, whereas in Godeševo they always appear as /a/.
            Examples: bəjàčkə (K1: 43), jàdene (K1: 58), bìblijàtə (O: 60) // struš’ɛ̀vəše (K4: 62), publəž’ɛ̀və (K1: 44) // ja (G4: 18)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /ṛ/.  It appears as /ɤr/ in Kruševo but as /or/ in Godeševo.
            Examples: mɤ̀rdə (K3: 148), zəmɤ̀rzne (K1: 4) // zəmòrknuvà (G1: 16)
• Only in Kruševo, the sequence /str/ is simplified to /sr/.
            Example: srìži (K3: 122)
• Only in Godeševo, the vowel /e/ is raised in stressed syllables.
            Examples: izmet’è̝ (G1: 4), jədè̝m (G1: 8)
• Only in Godeševo, the high vowels /i/ and /u/ are replaced in stressed syllables by /əj/ and /əw/, respectively.
            Examples of /i/: svərə̀j (G1: 4), nə̀jvətə (G1: 6)
            Examples of /u/: kə̀wp (G3: 11), kə̀wpifmè (G3: 17)
 
Morphology
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns, and feminine plural nouns ending in /-e/, is /-to/ in Kruševo but /-te/ in Godeševo.
            Examples: kumpìretu (K1: 9), sìnuvètu (K1: 110) // ufcètu (K3: 110) // snòpete (G4: 3)
• Only in Kruševo, early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected form of L-participles.
            Example: vl’ezəli (K1: 50).
• Only in Kruševo, the complementizer da is frequently dropped in the negative future and future-in-the-past tenses.
            Examples: štèše fl’èzə (K3: 19), n’èmə mòž’em (K3: 108)

"Huhla","10018","Ivajlovgrad","EASTERN RUPIC: Thrace
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Thracian dialect group as such is not completely coterminous with the geographical region called Thrace; at the same time parts of the eastern Rhodopes are within this group. Thracian dialects are spoken in the valley of the river Marica and to the south of it, and to the northeast of it in the direction of Burgas. There are two sub-groups, northern and southern, which are separated by the river Arda (Bojadžiev 1991: 33). The northern group is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Haskovo: Kralevo (K), Malevo (M), Stalevo (S), Vŭglarovo (V). The southern group is represented by two villages from the region of Ivajlovgrad, Drabishna (D) and Huhla (H). Because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Thracian dialect. It is based on the speech of the six villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kralevo 1, D2 = Drabišna 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Haskovo region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Hsk.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears regularly as /e/.
            Examples: t’ènku (H2: 105; S4: 56), žènəlu (M1: 192), dl’ègi (K1: 47)
• The historical Slavic nasal vowels appear as in the standard language: /ɤ/ for the back nasal and /e/ for the front nasal, including after post-alveolar consonants. The only exception (the only evidence of the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals”) is the word for ‘handful’.
            Examples for back nasal: pɤ̀ti (H5: 25), rɤ̀kə (V2: 44)
            Examples for front nasal: ž’ètvə (D4: 4, M1: 184), š’ètəm (H2: 43) //: šɤ̀pkə (D2: 13)
      Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and the historical sequences and “post-alveolar + a”. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. The change is especially common after post-alveolar consonants.

   If the consonant preceding this loss is a sonorant, it is sometimes lengthened; this change has been called “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: stàr:te (M1: 33), r’ətè̝n:tu (S1: 62)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before an initial stressed /e/.

• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dòrə (D2: 138), tòjtu (H3: 51), duòl’ni (K1: 11), utòri (S1: 169), òlvet (V2: 38)

            Examples: mlògu (H2: 43, M2: 77, V1: 100)
• The sequence /str/ is replaced by /sr/.
            Examples: srìgələ (S1: 13), srùnkə (V1: 6), nəsɤ̀rgənə (H1: 17)

            Examples: stuv’ɤ̀t (H6: 15), dvìme (K2: 58), duv’àhne (H4: 34)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: l’àhə (V2: 53), nògə (d1: 23), čòrbə (S2: (74), dɤ̀ski (M1: 253), sèsri (V1: 74) // bràšnu (V1: 123), mòmč’etə (D1: 68), t’èletə (M2: 102)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.

            Examples: s’enni (D2: 98), kàž’te (H1: 4), zàmesɨ (M1: 265), sùrni (S1: 107) vɤ̀rši (V2: 24)
 
Morphology
• The masculine plural ending is /-e/.
            Examples: kòkəle (D2: 177), prof’èsure (K2: 83), dòkture (S2: 11)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: udɤ̀tə (D1: 84), vujnɤ̀ (H6: 62), žinɤ̀tə (K1: 18), gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for “arm” and “leg” is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rəkìti (M2: 39), nugì (H3: 47)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Examples: səjvànetu (D1: 84), kəlàmetu̥ (S1: 112), òluvetu (V2: 98), ubòretu (H3: 34)

            3rd singular nominative neuter: tòj (D2: 72, K2: 74)
            3rd singular accusative masculine: n’ègə (K3: 43)
            3rd singular accusative feminine: nèhi (S4: 48)
            3rd plural accusative short form: hi (D1: 93), i (D2: 57)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (M1: 113), hni (S4: 40)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Examples: sòo (D1: 50), svà (K1: 2), tvà (S1: 117, D1: 4; K3: 8), nvà (H3: 52)
• The pronoun “kakǔv” and its derivatives are used instead of “koj” in adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkəv dèn’ (H3: 31), n’àkəf pɤ̀t (K2: 92; M1: 190), n’àkəv drɤ̀n (S3: 31)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: s’àkutri (H5: 41)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frɤ̀t (D2: 67)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dun’èsəh (D2: 13), fl’àzəhme (K1: 2), p’è̝kəh (V1: 123)
• The present stem is used in the aorist forms and L-participles of some verbs.
            Examples: zberàh (H3: 35), səberàl (K3: 50)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Example: plàtəne (H6: 26), izvàdəš (K2: 78), hàtəme (M1: 158), s’àtəhme (S4: 34)
• Secondary imperfective forms of certain verbs end in -icam instead of expected -ičam.
            Example: ublìcəli (S4: 47)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: dušlìli (H2: 63, D2: 7), reklìli (K3: 40)
• The future particle is zə in all villages except Huhla, where it is še.
            Examples: zə (D1: 42, K1: 3, M2: 4, S1: 4, V1: 28) // še (H6: 93)
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
     Both the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and etymological “ja” behave differently in the two subgroups.
•  Historical Slavic “jat”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group, it always appears as /’a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group it appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/, depending on the nature of the following syllable (that is, as in the standard language), except in aorist verb endings, where it is /e/.
            Examples: s’àme (D1: 42), gul’àmijə (H5: 11) // b’àhə (K1: 40), d’àdu (S4: 33), bèše (K1: 12).
            Example of aorist form: umr’è (M1: 54)
   Within the northern group, the front vowel that appears before palatalizing environment takes different phonetic forms. It is the open vowel /ɛ/ in Stalevo (though sometimes also /e/), but is raised to the more closed vowel /e̝/ in the other villages.
            Examples: : sm’ɛ̀n’əš (S1: 173), p’ɛ̀j (S1: 146) //  jədèše (S2: 73) // pusè̝iš (K1: 84)
    Finally, “jat” appears as /a/ after the /c/ in both the northern and southern groups.
            Examples: càl’ (H1: 81; M1: 192; V2: 14)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group these always appear as /a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group they appear   either as the back vowel /a/ or the open front vowel /ɛ/ depending on the nature of the following syllable (except after /j/, where the result is always /a/).
            Examples: teč’àš’e (D1: 84), uč’àhne (H2: 78) // issušàvə (S2: 51), nədnič’ɛret (M1: 184), uvəž’ɛvəhə (M1: 34), dərž’ɛ̀vi (S2: 88) // jàdenetu (M1: 113), vijàl’ki (M1: 238)
• The northern (Haskovo) group presents an interesting set of changes implementing what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift.
      First, the vowel /e/ is frequently raised to /e̝/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: sè̝lu (K1: 19), b’è̝hme (S1: 70), dvè̝ (V2: 34)
      Second, the high vowel /i/ is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: burɨ̀lu (K2: 77), vərtɨ̀ (M1: 233), bərdɨ̀lu (S1: 143), ugurɨ̀š (V1: 120)
      This chain shift continued, but only in Stalevo, with an occasional retraction of /ɤ/ to /ʌ/.
            Examples: gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3), jədʌ̀t (S2: 3)
 
Morphology
        The following traits are characteristic of the southern (Ivajlovgrad) dialect group.
• The 1st person plural ending /-ne/ for all tenses.
            Examples: klàvəne (D1: 49), glubine (H2: 64) // hrànehne (D1: 49), b’àhne (H6: 32) // stòrihne (H6: 30)
• Instances, albeit infrequent, of 1st person singular present tense endings characteristic of Rhodope dialects, namely /-m/ in verbs of the 1st and 2nd conjugations, and /-a/ in prefixed verbs of the 3rd conjugation.
            Examples: trɤ̀s’em (D2: 68), č’ètəm (H2: 67) // zàčukə (H6: 56)
• The future-in-the-past tense is formed with the future particle and the imperfect form of the verb.
            Example: še ìməše (H3: 46)

The complex dialectal variation of Bulgarian is best described within three major categories; the detailed description below follows this outline.
       The rubric Phonology describes the sound system of a dialect. Because the current forms (""reflexes"") of historical Slavic vowels divide the region so systematically, they are used as cover symbols for current lexical distribution of these sounds.
       The rubric Accent notes systematic differences in accent placement from the standard language; these are usually associated with grammatically-defined groups.
       The rubric Morphology describes features of nouns, pronouns and verbs that differ from the standard language in particularly noteworthy ways. 
",""
"Stalevo","10017","Xaskovo","EASTERN RUPIC: Thrace
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Thracian dialect group as such is not completely coterminous with the geographical region called Thrace; at the same time parts of the eastern Rhodopes are within this group. Thracian dialects are spoken in the valley of the river Marica and to the south of it, and to the northeast of it in the direction of Burgas. There are two sub-groups, northern and southern, which are separated by the river Arda (Bojadžiev 1991: 33). The northern group is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Haskovo: Kralevo (K), Malevo (M), Stalevo (S), Vŭglarovo (V). The southern group is represented by two villages from the region of Ivajlovgrad, Drabishna (D) and Huhla (H). Because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Thracian dialect. It is based on the speech of the six villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kralevo 1, D2 = Drabišna 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Haskovo region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Hsk.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears regularly as /e/.
            Examples: t’ènku (H2: 105; S4: 56), žènəlu (M1: 192), dl’ègi (K1: 47)
• The historical Slavic nasal vowels appear as in the standard language: /ɤ/ for the back nasal and /e/ for the front nasal, including after post-alveolar consonants. The only exception (the only evidence of the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals”) is the word for ‘handful’.
            Examples for back nasal: pɤ̀ti (H5: 25), rɤ̀kə (V2: 44)
            Examples for front nasal: ž’ètvə (D4: 4, M1: 184), š’ètəm (H2: 43) //: šɤ̀pkə (D2: 13)
      Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and the historical sequences and “post-alveolar + a”. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. The change is especially common after post-alveolar consonants.

   If the consonant preceding this loss is a sonorant, it is sometimes lengthened; this change has been called “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: stàr:te (M1: 33), r’ətè̝n:tu (S1: 62)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before an initial stressed /e/.
            Examples: jèdru (H3: 51), jètərvi (S1: 10)

DIFFERENCES
Phonology
     Both the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and etymological “ja” behave differently in the two subgroups.
•  Historical Slavic “jat”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group, it always appears as /’a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group it appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/, depending on the nature of the following syllable (that is, as in the standard language), except in aorist verb endings, where it is /e/.
            Examples: s’àme (D1: 42), gul’àmijə (H5: 11) // b’àhə (K1: 40), d’àdu (S4: 33), bèše (K1: 12).
            Example of aorist form: umr’è (M1: 54)
   Within the northern group, the front vowel that appears before palatalizing environment takes different phonetic forms. It is the open vowel /ɛ/ in Stalevo (though sometimes also /e/), but is raised to the more closed vowel /e̝/ in the other villages.
            Examples: : sm’ɛ̀n’əš (S1: 173), p’ɛ̀j (S1: 146) //  jədèše (S2: 73) // pusè̝iš (K1: 84)
    Finally, “jat” appears as /a/ after the /c/ in both the northern and southern groups.
            Examples: càl’ (H1: 81; M1: 192; V2: 14)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group these always appear as /a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group they appear   either as the back vowel /a/ or the open front vowel /ɛ/ depending on the nature of the following syllable (except after /j/, where the result is always /a/).
            Examples: teč’àš’e (D1: 84), uč’àhne (H2: 78) // issušàvə (S2: 51), nədnič’ɛret (M1: 184), uvəž’ɛvəhə (M1: 34), dərž’ɛ̀vi (S2: 88) // jàdenetu (M1: 113), vijàl’ki (M1: 238)
• The northern (Haskovo) group presents an interesting set of changes implementing what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift.
      First, the vowel /e/ is frequently raised to /e̝/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: sè̝lu (K1: 19), b’è̝hme (S1: 70), dvè̝ (V2: 34)
      Second, the high vowel /i/ is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: burɨ̀lu (K2: 77), vərtɨ̀ (M1: 233), bərdɨ̀lu (S1: 143), ugurɨ̀š (V1: 120)

            Examples: gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3), jədʌ̀t (S2: 3)
 
Morphology
        The following traits are characteristic of the southern (Ivajlovgrad) dialect group.
• The 1st person plural ending /-ne/ for all tenses.
            Examples: klàvəne (D1: 49), glubine (H2: 64) // hrànehne (D1: 49), b’àhne (H6: 32) // stòrihne (H6: 30)
• Instances, albeit infrequent, of 1st person singular present tense endings characteristic of Rhodope dialects, namely /-m/ in verbs of the 1st and 2nd conjugations, and /-a/ in prefixed verbs of the 3rd conjugation.
            Examples: trɤ̀s’em (D2: 68), č’ètəm (H2: 67) // zàčukə (H6: 56)
• The future-in-the-past tense is formed with the future particle and the imperfect form of the verb.
            Example: še ìməše (H3: 46)

"Skrŭt","10016","Petrič","SOUTHWESTERN: Petrič
            Within the larger region of Southwestern Bulgarian dialects, the southernmost section is represented on this site by the Petrič group, with the two villages of Gorna Krušica (GK) and Skrŭt (S). Many authors, including those of the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/), do not distinguish the Petrič group from the Blagoevgrad dialect group. However, because these two villages are so far from Blagoevgrad, and because there is a precedent for labeling the Petrič group as separate (Stojkov 1993: 159 – though even he notes that it is “very similar” to the Blagoevgrad dialect), the Petrič dialect is viewed here as a separate group. 
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Petrič dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. GK1 = Gorna Krušica 1, S2 = Skrŭt 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology:
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” usually appears as /e/ except after the consonant /c/ where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: namèsto (GK1: 22), nèkoj (GK1: 97), mlèko (1: 23) // cadìlka (GK2: 24), càl (S2: 79)
    Since this dialect is located near the major “jat isogloss” it is not surprising to find sporadic forms with /’a/ for “jat”.
            Example: gol’àmi (S2: 108)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” appears as /a/.
            Examples: stàpa (GK2: 6), oràt (GK2: 21), poràčva (S1: 22), vàgle (S3: 78)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back jer” appears as /a/ or /o/ in root morphemes, and as /o/ in affixes and in the definite article.
            Examples: làžeš (S1: 43), navònka (S1: 200) // sobèremè (GK1: 7), takòf (GK1: 83),         pisòk (S1: 162) // balkàno (GK 3:50), lèbo (S1: 28)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears as /e/.
            Examples: tèmnoto (GK3: 23), ošèl (S1: 38)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /r/ appears as /rɤ/, and early South Slavic syllabic /l/ appears as /ɤ/.
            Examples: vrɤtìme (GK1: 22), krɤ̀pi (GK1: 38), brɤ̀kat (S2: 22), drɤ̀veni (S2: 32) // vɤ̀nata (GK3: 37)
• The consonant /x/ is preserved word-finally; elsewhere it is lost.
            Examples: udarìx (GK1: 156), nìx (GK2: 31), odìh (S1: 53) // òdi (GK1: 148), lèbo (S1: 28), òro (S1: 89)
• The behavior of /x/ in past tense verbal endings before a consonant is different in the two villages. In Skrŭt it disappears or is replaced by /j/, while in Gorna Krušica it is sometimes preserved. More frequently it disappears, having caused lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: odìme (S2: 11), edèjme (S3: 13), pòstejme (S3: 28) // sčepkàxme (GK3: 35), vìka:me (GK1: 20), kàzva:me (GK1: 29)
     There appears in both villages to be a correlation between verbal tense and behavior of /x/: forms in which it is lost are those of the aorist, while those in which it is replaced by /j/ or lengthening are those of the imperfect. There is too little data to make a categorical claim, however.
• Palatal consonants may appear in word final position.
            Examples: dèn’ (S2: 154), ògin’ (S3: 78)
• There may be anticipation of softness with the softness remaining on the consonant.
            Example: tigàjn’ (S3: 22)
• Soft /t’/ is replaced by soft /k’/.
            Examples: svàk’ata (GK1: 135), pàk’o (S3: 85)
• The sequence /vn/ is assimilated to /mn/.
            Example: glamnìte (S2: 25)
• In Skrŭt the consonant /j/ is lost when it occurs between two vowels.
            Examples: mòa (S2: 16), nèa (S2: 151), pèat (S2: 85)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: ùlicìte (GK1: 5), tàpanèto (S2: 32), svàbvitè le (GK1: 2)
• The accent is retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: òfce (GK2: 22), kòzi (GK2: 22), dèca (GK1: 44), òro (S1: 89), mèso (S2: 48)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in many verbs from the 2nd conjugation.
            Examples: ròdi (GK2: 38), issùšime (GK: 25), gòdat (S2: 7), svàri (S3: 45)
• The accent is retracted to initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: pèča (GK2: 19), ìzvadàm (GK2: 21)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative forms.
            Examples: òdi (GK1: 148), dròbi (S3: 40)
•The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles, including in the presence of a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: odìl (S1: 7), pobegnàl (S1: 62), slagàli (GK1: 4)
 
Morphology
• The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jàs (GK1: 86, S1: 18),
            3rd singular nominative masculine òn (S1: 32)
            3rd singular nominative feminine onà (GK1: 137)
            3rd singular nominative neuter onò (GK1: 137)
            1st plural nominative nìeka (GK1: 50)
            3rd plural nominative  onì (GK 1:134)
            3rd plural accusative nìx (GK2: 31, S1: 77)
            3rd plural accusative short form i (S2:150)
• The accent placement in third person nominative pronouns differs between the two villages.
            Examples: onà (GK1: 137), onì (GK1: 132) // òna (S1: 12), òni (S1: 87)
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/ or /-je/.
            Examples: kazàne (GK1: 12), peškìrje (GK1: 7), ribàre (S1: 65)
• The masculine singular definite article is /-o/.
            Examples: svèkaro (GK1: 85), ògino (S1: 25)
• The masculine plural article is /-to/.
            Examples: stanovèto (GK1: 36), tapanàreto (S2: 42)
• The ending in 1st person singular present tense for verbs of 1st and 2d conjugation is /-a/ for all unprefixed verbs. For prefixed verbs it is also /-a/ in S, but it is /-am/ in GK.
            Examples: kàža (S1: 1), ìda (S1: 18), mèsa (GK2: 2), pèča (GK2: 19) // navàl’a (S1: 55), òdnesàm (GK2: 25), ìstkaam (GK3: 25)
• Verbs of the 2nd conjugation have hard consonants preceding the endings of 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense forms.  
            Examples: òženàm (GK2: 26), kànat (S2: 41)
 • The ending in 1st person plural present tense for verbs of 1st and 2d conjugation is /-me/, though sometimes also /-m/.
            Examples: tkàeme (GK1: 5), sèdneme (GK1: 10), òdime (S1: 18) // dòim (S3: 14), izlèzem (S3: 20)
• The future particle is ke or ki.
            Examples: ke fànete (GK1: 129), ki dòe (S1: 9)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-n/.
            Example: sèjan (S3: 60)
• The present stem is used in aorist forms, L-participles, and passive participles in some verb classes.
            Examples: pokažàx (GK3: 10), mažàli (GK1: 97), zanìženi (S1: 37), kažàli (S1: 87)
• Intransitive verbs can be used as transitive.
            Example: ki go zàspiš (S1: 20)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
• In Skrŭt there is a theme vowel generalization for 1st and 2nd conjugation verbs, to /-i-/ in 2nd singular forms and /-e-/ in 3rd singular forms.
            Examples: srètniš (S1: 141) // gàle (S1: 38), pròste (S1: 93)
• In Gorna Krušica the morpheme /-še-/ is incorporated into all plural forms of the imperfect tense.
            Example: zìmašèa (GK3: 32)

"Šumnatica","10015","Momčilgrad","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Tihomir
               The village of Tihomir is located in the eastern Rhodopes, in the southernmost part of the Krumovgrad area. Little if anything was known about its dialect before Stajko Kabasanov published his monograph description (Kabasanov 1963). Because of its highly archaic features, it has subsequently attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. 
               Kabasanov’s view is that the dialect is unique and cannot be grouped with those of neighboring dialects into a single system, but that it nevertheless does share a number of phonetic and lexical features with these neighboring villages (Kabasanov 1963: 3). The authors of the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/) view the group this way, calling it the Tihomir dialect. We describe here together the two villages on the website from this group, that of Tihomir itself (T) and that of Šumnatica (Š). At the same time we recognize the uniqueness of the Tihomir dialect by listing features specific to it alone separately (at the end of the Phonology and Morphology sections, respectively).
            The list below summarizes the salient features representing both Tihomir and the wider Tihomir group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. T1 = Tihomir 1, Š2 = Šumnatica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” usually appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  but sometimes also as /e/.
               Examples: l’ɛ̀p  (T1: 46), bɛ̀ga  (T1: 72), gr’ɛ̀e  (Š1: 45), bɛ̀lu  (Š3: 226), cɛ̀lu  (Š3: 36) // l’èbate  (T2: 44)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”  appear in stressed syllables as /ɛ/  in Tihomir and as /a/  in Šumnatica.
               Examples: č’ɛkə  (T1: 83), jɛ̀sla  (T3: 12) // jàdene  (Š3: 106), č’àkəš  (Š3: 132)
•  As in other Rhodope dialects, there is a merger of the four classic historical Slavic vowels (both “jers” and both nasals), with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones (Miletič 1912: 29). Here, however, the vowel that results is different in the two dialects: it is /ɔ/  in Tihomir, but /a/  in Šumnatica. On occasion, front “jer” can appear as /e/.
               Examples for back “jer”:  dɔ̀ska  (T3: 75), isɔ̀hne  (T2: 92) // svetàt  (Š1: 35)
               Examples for back nasal: gɔ̀bi  (T3: 71), krɔ̀pa  (T1: 178) // kàštata  (Š3: 109)
               Examples for front “jer”:  ap’ɔ̀neš  (T1: 246),  tènka  (T21: 189) // l’àsnu  (Š3: 150), zèmeš (Š3: 216) 
               Examples for front nasal: pr’ɔ̀dena  (T1: 190), zat’ɔgneme  (T1: 179) // gl‘àdəj (Š3: 161)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appears as /ɔr/  and /ɔl/  in Tihomir, and as /ar/  and /al/  in Šumnatica.
               Examples: vɔ̀rtneš  (T1: 242), pɔ̀rsten’e  (T1: 24), napɔ̀lni  (T1: 246), vɔ̀lnata  (T1: 245) // pàrskani  (Š3: 46), vàlnətə  (Š3: 218)
• The consonant /x/  is either replaced by /h/,  or lost altogether, without regard to position in the word.  
               Examples: hurkəi  (T1: 202), hàrkmətə  (Š3: 82), drabɛ̀han  (T2: 182), səberàhə  (Š2: 29) // òrə  (Š1: 23), lɛ̀p  (T1: 46), klad’èmen  (T2: 113), izb’agəə  (Š2: 30)
• The sequence /dn/  is either assimilated to /nn/,  or simplified to /n/.
               Examples: spànne  (T1: 171), s’enneš  (Š3: 111) // pònicɔ  (T2: 11)
• The sequence /bn/  is assimilated to /mn/.
               Example: drèmničku  (Š2: 28) [no examples in attested in Tihomir texts]
 
PHONOLOGICAL FEATURES SPECIFIC TO TIHOMIR
• Whereas in nearly all other Bulgarian dialects, the historical Slavic vowel “jery”  (Cyrillic ы) merged with /i/,  in Tihomir it retained its original lexical distribution, and appears as a high front unrounded vowel with a centralized on-glide, /əi/.  In unstressed syllables it sometimes appears as /ɤ/. 
               Examples: aməìeme  (T2: 35), bəìva  (T2: 159), drùgɤkvəi  (T1: 141), kòrəi  (T2: 60) // dùpkɤ  (T3: 75)
• Like many (but not all) dialects spoken by Bulgarian Muslims, Tihomir is characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by /a/. What is specific to Tihomir is that this happens not just in pretonic syllables but in all unstressed syllables.
               Examples: apìnaš  (T1: 217), kòpeleta  (T1: 72), mnòga  (T1: 179)
• In Tihomir the vowel /e/  is replaced by /o/  in stressed syllables after postalveolar consonants.
               Examples: jòrš  (T3: 61), varšòme  (T3: 50), ž’òna  (T1: 78)
• The Tihomir dialect has long consonants; they appear in the plural forms of masculine nouns and in verbal nouns.
               Examples: kamiòn:e  (T1: 41), sakùl’:e  (T2: 212), jàden:e  (T3: 57)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: dɔ̀ska  (T3: 75), ž’òna  (T1: 78), žèna  (Š1: 15) // k’ɛsta (T2: 57), dɔ̀rvo  (T3: 39), t’èle  (Š3: 175)
• The accent is retracted to the first syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: zàpitam  (Š1: 44), klàdəm  (T2: 136)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: vìdi  (Š3: 261), zàkərpi  (Š3: 161)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: pɔ̀rsten’e  (T1: 24), gr’èbene  (T1: 99), džuràpe  (Š3: 209), burkàne  (Š3: 12)
• Like other Rhodope dialects, these too have the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: ajlɔ̀kət  (T1: 47), matavìlkanɔ  (T1: 264), svetàt  (Š1: 45), sičkunu  (Š3: 211)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (or /-so/,  /-no/).
            Examples: stàn:eto  (T1: 141), čaìreto  (T2: 16)// [no examples of proximal or distal articles attested in the texts]
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
            Examples: sɛ̀e  (T1: 201), tòo  (T2: 215), nvà  (T3: 2), svà  (Š1: 45), tàa  (Š1: 15), nvà  (Š3: 236)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function. In addition, the form nèkva  is used in place of  nèšto ‘something’.
               Examples: n’akəkvi izb’agəə  (Š2: 30), pòsle adème nèkva  (T1: 34)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Examples: kənà (Š3: 156), kanà (T1: 1)
• The 1st person singular present tense ending for all verbs is /-m/.
               Examples: kàžəm  (T1: 1), tɔ̀čem  (T1: 102), pràm  (Š3: 93)
• Plural past tense endings add a final consonant /n/.
               Examples: bèən  (Š2: 37), zəkrìən  (Š4: 8), drabɛ̀han  (T2: 182), klad’èmen  (T2: 113)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Example: dàdəme (Š1: 93)
ª The present stem is used in the aorist form of some verbs.
               Example: səberàhə  (Š2: 29)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
               Examples: kàžuvame  (T1: 219), ràdɤše  (T1: 38), fàte  (Š3: 166)
 
MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES SPECIFIC TO TIHOMIR
• Non-nominative forms of feminine nouns are in regular use. The ending is usually the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/,  and sometimes /o/  or /ɯ/ (a high, back rounded vowel similar to Turkish /ı/).
            Examples: matavìlkɔ  (T1: 227), pònicɔ  (T2: 11) // hùrko  (T1: 201), aràpkɯ (T1: 39)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, such nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven): the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case (whose ending was the back nasal vowel) and was used for all other meanings.
• The Tihomir dialect is unique in that it preserves non-nominative forms for all masculine nouns (whereas the few other dialects which preserve non-nominative forms only do so for masculine nouns signifying an animate being). The ending for these forms is -/ɤ/  or /-a/. 
               Examples: klìnɤ  (T1: 31) tòka  (T1: 140)
   The definite non-nominative form of masculine nouns ends in /-ate/.
               Examples:  stanàte  (T1: 101), l’èbat’e  (T2: 40)
• The Tihomir dialect uses the relative pronoun “ažit”.
               Examples: ažìt ìma d’uvène  (T2: 182), ažòto znàm  (T1: 1)

"Leštak","10014","Madan","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Zlatograd
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            The dialect of Zlatograd is represented on the website by the villages Leštak (L) and Vŭrbina (V).  These villages, in fact, are transitional to the Smoljan dialect, with major traits connecting them to the Smoljan dialect on the one hand, and to the Zlatograd dialect on the other.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Zlatograd dialect. It is based on the speech of the two villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. L1 = Leštak 1, V2 = Vŭrbina 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/  or /e/;  the former is more frequent in Leštak, and the latter is more frequent in Vŭrbina. After the consonant /c/  in the word ‘entire’ it appears as /a/.
            Examples: gulɛ̀mi  (L1: 45), mlɛ̀ku  (L1: 3) mɛ̀stu  (L2: 69), v’ɛ̀lu  (V1: 11), l’ɛ̀hi  (V3: 36); prolètenu  (L2: 29), l’èbə  (V2: 62) // càlənə  (L1: 32), càltə  (V2: 51)
• The  historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat” appear in stressed syllables as /ɛ/.
            Examples: čɛ̀snicite  (L1: 5), tujɛ̀gə  (L3: 410), kujədž’ɛ̀k  (L2: 80), kučɛ̀ni  (V4: 53), užɛ̀ci  (V3: 53)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “ back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/  or /ʌ/. (See below for commentary on the vowel /ʌ/).
            Examples for back jer:  dʌ̀ski  (L1: 20), isʌ̀hne  (L2: 42), dɤ̀šterə ( V3: 55)
            Examples for back nasal: nəzɤ̀benku  (L3: 151), prʌ̀čkə  (L3: 406), mɤ̀ž’uve  (V1: 37)
     It is this trait (back jer  and back nasal appearing as /ɤ/  or /ʌ/)  that connects the speech of these villages with the Zlatograd dialect.
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/  or /’ʌ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, although all such words can also optionally occur with /e/.
            Examples for front jer:  l’ɤsnu  (L1: 77, V1: 39), z’ɤ̀meš  (L1: 33), l’ʌ̀ku  (L3: 101);           l’èku  (V4: 42)
            Examples for front nasal: gl’ɤ̀dəli  (V1: 23), ispr’ɤ̀denə,  m’ʌ̀su  (L1: 65), jʌ̀dri  (L3: 134), gl’èdəš  (L2: 35)
     As elsewhere in the Rhodopes, the merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers  and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a significant defining feature of their “Rhodope” affiliation. (Miletič 1912: 29). Indeed, it is this trait that connects the speech of these two villages with the Smoljan dialect.
    Note on the vowel /ʌ/:  In Vŭrbina, the vowel /ʌ/ is a phonetic variant appearing after labial consonants; in Leštak, however, it is the basic variant and appears nearly everywhere.
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɤr/  and /ɤl/.
            Examples: pɤ̀rs  (V4: 92), vɤ̀rštəm  (V2: 60), nəpɤ̀lni  (L3: 424), bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23)
• The vowel /i/  is replaced by /’u/  before labial consonants. The reverse change, the replacement of /u/  after soft consonant by /i/,  is attested only in Vŭrbina.
            Examples for /i/ > /’u/:  l’uvàtki  (L2: 70), čuvìjə  (L3: 363), ž’uvèi  (V1: 39) 
            Example for /u/ > /i/:  jinìcə  (V2: 37)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: càrvicə  (L1: 28), tvàr’ət  (L1: 20), càltu  (V2: 51), zvè̝me  (V2: 18)
• The consonant /x/  is replaced by /h/  in all positions, and is sometimes lost word-initially.
            Examples: isʌ̀hne  (L2: 57), bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23) hòd’əm  (V3: 45) // l’èbə  (V2: 62), umòt’  (L3: 232)
• With rare exceptions, the affricate /dž/  is replaced by the fricative /ž/.
            Examples: g’um’urz’ìne (V1: 27), bəžɤ̀nə  (V3: 106), sež’ìm  (L3:   267) // kujədž’ɛ̀k (L2: 80)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: umòt’  (L3: 232), fəsul’  (V4: 9)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23), vɤ̀l’n’eni  (V4: 83)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: rɤ̀kə  (L3: 157), kòzə  (L1: 85), bɤ̀l’hi  (V3: 23); t’èle  (L1: 85), dɤ̀rvu  (V4: 104)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the 1st person singular present tense form.
            Examples: òmur’ə  (V3: 59), s’èdəm  (V3: 48)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperatives.
            Examples: vɤ̀ri  (L1: 41), òpeni  (L3: 424), zàkuli  (V2: 24)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: həjvàne  (L3: 75), kətɤ̀re  (L3: 56), kàmene  (V4: 94)
• Feminine nouns ending in a consonant have shifted to the masculine gender.
            Examples: sɤ̀štijə kàl  (V4: 92), ədɨ̀n p̀è̝š  (V2: 51)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: metlɤ̀ (L3: 43), pl’əvɤ̀nə (V1: 10)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for ‘arm’ and ‘leg’ is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rɤ̀ki  (V3: 84), nògi  (V3: 42)
• A significant defining feature of Rhodope dialects is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (= “medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: sʌ̀rpəs  (L2: 42), mesòtu  (L1: 88), l’ɛ̀tunu  (L1: 31)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (or /-so/,  /-no/).
            Examples: kòl’etu  (L1: 82), snòpetu  (L3: 54) // [no examples of proximal or distal articles attested in the texts]
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
            Examples: sàe  (L1: 4), tva’  (l1: 56), nvà  (V4: 70)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (L1: 23)
            3rd plural accusative: hi  (V4: 72) or i  (V4: 30)
• The pronoun kakŭv  and its derivatives are used instead of koj  with adjectival function.
            Examples: nɛ̀kvə l’uvàtkə  (L2: 70), nɛ̀kəf kujədž’ɛ̀k  (L2: 80), n’èkvə gudɨ̀nə  (V3: 104)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kinà (L2: 83, V2: 15)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrɤ̀  (V4: 4)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: vrìt (L2: 54)
• Verbs of all three conjugations have the same endings in 1st person singular present tense forms of unprefixed verbs: /-m/. In prefixed verbs it is either /-m/  or /-a/.
            Examples: hòd’əm  (V3: 45), s’edəm  (V3: 48) // zàmes’əm  (V2: 60), òmur’ə  (V3: 59)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: bilìli ( L2: 44), dušlìli  (V4: 3)
• Passive participles are frequently formed with the suffix /-t/.
            Examples: iskuvàtu  (V3: 88), sml’èti  (V1: 54)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Examples: fàtəš  (L2: 44), ràdəhə  (V4: 75)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
Three phonetic features are found in Vŭrbina, but not in Leštak.
• The vowel /e/  is frequently raised in stressed syllables, including as a reflex of “jat”.
            Examples: pè̝čki  (V3: 103), pè̝š  (V2: 61), mè̝secə  (V2: 26)
• The vowel /i/  is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: sɨ̀tu  (V1: 9), gudɨ̀nə  (V3: 72)
• The vowel /o/  in stressed syllables is replaced by /wo/.
            Examples: wòs’em  (V3: 82), wògən’ən  (V3: 103), nətwòč’eni  (V3: 8)

"Kruševo","10013","Goce Delčev","WESTERN RUPIC: Čeč (Godeševo, Kruševo, Oreše)
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the westernmost portion of Rupic includes a number of quite distinct dialect groups, among which is the “Čeč dialect”. This dialect is represented on this site by three villages, Kruševo, Oreše, and Godeševo. According to the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/), all three are constituent members of this group. All three belong to the administrative region of Goce Delčev and all three are located relatively close to the town of Goce Delčev. Linguistically, however, they are quite distinct from the dialect of Goce Delčev, both as described in the classical work of Kiril Mirčev (Mirčev 1936) and as exemplified by the village Kovačevo on this website. It is therefore correct to place them in the Čeč dialect group rather than the Goce Delčev one.
            There are also significant differences within the Čeč group between the dialect of Godeševo on the one hand and that of Kruševo and Oreše on the other: the former shares a number of traits with Rhodope dialects whereas the latter are transitional between the Čeč and Goce Delčev dialect groups. Nevertheless, because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the dialect of Godeševo, Kruševo and Oreše. It is based on the speech of these three village as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above (O = Oreše); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kruševo 1, G2 = Godeševo 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /o/.
            Example of “back jer”:  čəsò (G1: 9), dòš’ (K1: 2), zəsòhnələ (K1: 73), kəkòf (K3: 86)
            Examples of “back nasal”:  ukòpiš (G2: 2), ležòd (G1: 8) kòštə (K1: 100), ispredòt (K1: 111)
   This is one of the major differentiating traits between the Čeč dialect, and that of Goce Delčev (where it appears as /ɤ/).
     Note: Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat”, front nasal and front jer. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cɤr/.
            Examples: cɤ̀rnətə (K3: 164), pucɤrven’èe (K4: 52) [no examples in Godeševo texts]

• In verbal endings for past tenses, /x/ is lost intervocalically, replaced by /f/ word-finally, and lost or replaced by /f/ (and rarely by /v/) before another consonant.
            Examples of intervocalic /x/: utkàrəà jə (K1: 28)
            Examples of word-final /x/: l’ekuvəf (2: 43), iskàrəf (K1: 6) 
            Examples of /x/ before consonant: utìdəme (K1: 6), pràfme (K3: 42), bèvme (O: 34), kə̀wpifmè (G3: 17)
• There is anticipation of softness.
            Example: vèjke (K4: 11) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• Soft consonants may appear word-finally.
            Examples: fəsùl’ (G1: 7), càl’ (G2: 4), živòt’ (O:8), gòsput’ (O: 55), berekèt’ (K4: 118), kumpìr’ (K4: 83)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Example: s’ènnə (K3: 175), [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ word-initially and to /vn/ elsewhere.
            Examples: mlògu (K1: 43), pòvni (K1: 85), t’èvnu (K4: 13),  zəpòvnili (G3: 4)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: zəmòrknuvà li (G1: 16), dubìtəkà gu (G4: 16), pudgòt’uvàme (K1: 7), ìskaràm (K1: 9), iskàzuvàn’etu̥ (O: 60)
• The accent is frequently retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Example: Examples: vòdə (K3: 155), r’èkətə (K4: 109), žèni (K1: 62) // m’èsu (K4: 28), d’ètetu (K2: 12), d’àtetu (G2: 2)

• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative.
            Examples: dònesi (K1: 16), kùtni (K3: 131) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
 
Morphology
 • The plural ending for the feminine nouns rɤka  ‘arm’ and noga  ‘leg’ is /-i/, rather than the ending /-e/ (a continuation of the old dual ending, found in the standard language and many dialects).
            Examples: rəkə̀jte (G3: 11), nugìte (G1: 9), nògi (K3: 133)
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ərgàte (K4: 59), burkàne (K4: 114), pərcàl’e (G2: 4)
• The definite article for masculine nouns is /-o/ if stressed and /-ə/ if unstressed.
            Examples: stanò (K3: 18), čəsò (K4: 18, G1: 9) // kəzàn’ə (K3: 158)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is /-o/, which is the result of the the historical Slavic “back nasal”.
            Example: zem’òtə (O: 41) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
      Such forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form).
• The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà (K1: 9), jàz (K1: 98), jà (G4: 18)
            1st plural nominative n’è (O: 43)
            3rd plural dative short form mi (K1: 44)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: sàa pròl’et (K3: 158), sàə (G3: 20) // tvà (G1: 10)
• The ending of 1st person plural present tense forms for prefixed verbs of all conjugations is either /-m/ or /-a/ (unstressed /-ə/); for unprefixed verbs it is always /-a/ if stressed and /-ə/ if unstressed.
            Examples: ìskaràm (K1: 9), òdnesàm (K1: 59) // òdnesə (K1: 56), ìzberə (K1: 55) // pràv’ə (K1: 61), žìv’ə (K1: 102), stòpl’ə (K2: 29) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Example: dòjdəhme (K3: 163) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• Intransitive verbs can be used transitively.
            Example: še gi nəl’àgəme (G1: 8)  [no examples in Kruševo or Oreše texts]
• Only the pronoun kakɤv and its derivatives are used with adjectival function, and never the pronoun koj.
            Example: nèkvi žèni (K12: 62) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frèt (K4: 79) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
The historical Slavic vowels “jat”, front nasal, and front “jer”, and the sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” behave differently in the two subgroups.
• Historical Slavic “jat”. It appears in stressed syllables as /e/ in Kruševo and Oreše, but as /’a/ in Godeševo. In both regions it appears as /a/ after the consonant /c/.
            Examples: m’èsec (K2: 10), izl’èlu (K1: 97), uts’èkəde (K1: 43) // s’ànkətə (G1: 15), d’àtetu (G2: 2), gul’àmi (G2: 8) // càl’ (K2: 10)
    This is one of the traits differentiating Čec from the dialect of Goce Delčev, where it appears as in the standard language.
• Historical Slavic front nasal and front “jer”. In Kruševo and Oreše these appear in stressed syllables as /e/ (with the front jer sometimes as /ɤ/), while in Godeševo they appear as /’o/ (i.e. /o/ with softening of the preceding consonant), though with certain exceptions.
            Example of “front jer”: tèničku (K1: 42), t’èvnu (K4: 13) / ž’ɤ̀neme (K4: 13) // ž’òneš (G1: 14) / dèn (G2: 4)
            Examples of  “front nasal”: izgl’èdələ (K1: 27), m’èsu (K4: 28), odm’èkne (K4: 47) // guv’òttə (G1: 19), izgl’òdəli (G2: 7)
    The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a basic Rhodope feature, and one of the primary features differentiating the dialect of Godeševo from that of Kruševo and Oreše.
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In Kruševo and Oreše they appear as /a/ after /j/, and as /ɛ/ after post-alveolar consonants, whereas in Godeševo they always appear as /a/.
            Examples: bəjàčkə (K1: 43), jàdene (K1: 58), bìblijàtə (O: 60) // struš’ɛ̀vəše (K4: 62), publəž’ɛ̀və (K1: 44) // ja (G4: 18)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /ṛ/.  It appears as /ɤr/ in Kruševo but as /or/ in Godeševo.
            Examples: mɤ̀rdə (K3: 148), zəmɤ̀rzne (K1: 4) // zəmòrknuvà (G1: 16)
• Only in Kruševo, the sequence /str/ is simplified to /sr/.
            Example: srìži (K3: 122)
• Only in Godeševo, the vowel /e/ is raised in stressed syllables.
            Examples: izmet’è̝ (G1: 4), jədè̝m (G1: 8)
• Only in Godeševo, the high vowels /i/ and /u/ are replaced in stressed syllables by /əj/ and /əw/, respectively.
            Examples of /i/: svərə̀j (G1: 4), nə̀jvətə (G1: 6)
            Examples of /u/: kə̀wp (G3: 11), kə̀wpifmè (G3: 17)
 
Morphology
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns, and feminine plural nouns ending in /-e/, is /-to/ in Kruševo but /-te/ in Godeševo.
            Examples: kumpìretu (K1: 9), sìnuvètu (K1: 110) // ufcètu (K3: 110) // snòpete (G4: 3)
• Only in Kruševo, early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected form of L-participles.
            Example: vl’ezəli (K1: 50).
• Only in Kruševo, the complementizer da is frequently dropped in the negative future and future-in-the-past tenses.
            Examples: štèše fl’èzə (K3: 19), n’èmə mòž’em (K3: 108)

"Kralevo","10012","Xaskovo","EASTERN RUPIC: Thrace
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Thracian dialect group as such is not completely coterminous with the geographical region called Thrace; at the same time parts of the eastern Rhodopes are within this group. Thracian dialects are spoken in the valley of the river Marica and to the south of it, and to the northeast of it in the direction of Burgas. There are two sub-groups, northern and southern, which are separated by the river Arda (Bojadžiev 1991: 33). The northern group is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Haskovo: Kralevo (K), Malevo (M), Stalevo (S), Vŭglarovo (V). The southern group is represented by two villages from the region of Ivajlovgrad, Drabishna (D) and Huhla (H). Because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Thracian dialect. It is based on the speech of the six villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kralevo 1, D2 = Drabišna 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Haskovo region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Hsk.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears regularly as /e/.
            Examples: t’ènku (H2: 105; S4: 56), žènəlu (M1: 192), dl’ègi (K1: 47)
• The historical Slavic nasal vowels appear as in the standard language: /ɤ/ for the back nasal and /e/ for the front nasal, including after post-alveolar consonants. The only exception (the only evidence of the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals”) is the word for ‘handful’.
            Examples for back nasal: pɤ̀ti (H5: 25), rɤ̀kə (V2: 44)
            Examples for front nasal: ž’ètvə (D4: 4, M1: 184), š’ètəm (H2: 43) //: šɤ̀pkə (D2: 13)
      Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and the historical sequences and “post-alveolar + a”. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. The change is especially common after post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: bỳvə (H1: 31), ut’ùəm (D1: 32), ž’uv̀è̝j (M2: 113), č’uvìjki (V2: 86)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: nd’àl’ə (H5: 22), dumàtentu (D1: 43), mlàtte (K2: 99), žəlzàtə (V2: 97)
   If the consonant preceding this loss is a sonorant, it is sometimes lengthened; this change has been called “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: stàr:te (M1: 33), r’ətè̝n:tu (S1: 62)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before an initial stressed /e/.
            Examples: jèdru (H3: 51), jètərvi (S1: 10)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cɤr/.
            Example: cɤ̀rn (H1: 22)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions; it is sometimes lost, without any apparent systemic rule.  
            Examples: b’àhə (K1: 40), bè̝hme (M1: 108), l’ahə (V2: 53) // l’abə (K2: 10), rànili (H6: 74), izgl’èdəə (D1: 15)
• In word-initial position, the consonant /f/ is replaced by /h/.
            Examples: hučì (s2: 3), hùrni (V1: 54), h udəìte (D1: 50)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: velìgden’ (D2: 29), həmbàr’ (M1: 254), rudàn’ (S1: 65), dè̝vet’ (V2: 56), žuòt’ (K1: 73)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: jàbəl’k’i (D2: 82), vijàl’ki (M1: 238), mɤ̀l’čə (V2: 122)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dòrə (D2: 138), tòjtu (H3: 51), duòl’ni (K1: 11), utòri (S1: 169), òlvet (V2: 38)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: pànnələ (D2: 162), nəpànnəli (K3: 63), s’è̝nnem (V2: 127)
• The sequences /bn/ and /vn/ are assimilated to /mn/.
            Examples: drèmničku (D1: 42), drèmnu (H3: 52), gràmnəd (K2: 51), ràmnu (H4: 5)
• The initial sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/.
            Examples: mlògu (H2: 43, M2: 77, V1: 100)
• The sequence /str/ is replaced by /sr/.
            Examples: srìgələ (S1: 13), srùnkə (V1: 6), nəsɤ̀rgənə (H1: 17)
• The consonant /j/ is replaced by /v/ after a rounded vowel.
            Examples: stuv’ɤ̀t (H6: 15), dvìme (K2: 58), duv’àhne (H4: 34)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: l’àhə (V2: 53), nògə (d1: 23), čòrbə (S2: (74), dɤ̀ski (M1: 253), sèsri (V1: 74) // bràšnu (V1: 123), mòmč’etə (D1: 68), t’èletə (M2: 102)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: pèrə (H6: 18), mɤ̀l’čə (V2: 122), zàvedə (D2: 100), pòberə (K1: 56), ìspečə (M1: 265)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllble in imperative forms.
            Examples: s’enni (D2: 98), kàž’te (H1: 4), zàmesɨ (M1: 265), sùrni (S1: 107) vɤ̀rši (V2: 24)
 
Morphology
• The masculine plural ending is /-e/.
            Examples: kòkəle (D2: 177), prof’èsure (K2: 83), dòkture (S2: 11)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: udɤ̀tə (D1: 84), vujnɤ̀ (H6: 62), žinɤ̀tə (K1: 18), gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for “arm” and “leg” is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rəkìti (M2: 39), nugì (H3: 47)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Examples: səjvànetu (D1: 84), kəlàmetu̥ (S1: 112), òluvetu (V2: 98), ubòretu (H3: 34)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (K1: 16), jàs (D1: 39); the first form is more frequent.
            3rd singular nominative neuter: tòj (D2: 72, K2: 74)
            3rd singular accusative masculine: n’ègə (K3: 43)
            3rd singular accusative feminine: nèhi (S4: 48)
            3rd plural accusative short form: hi (D1: 93), i (D2: 57)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (M1: 113), hni (S4: 40)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Examples: sòo (D1: 50), svà (K1: 2), tvà (S1: 117, D1: 4; K3: 8), nvà (H3: 52)
• The pronoun “kakǔv” and its derivatives are used instead of “koj” in adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkəv dèn’ (H3: 31), n’àkəf pɤ̀t (K2: 92; M1: 190), n’àkəv drɤ̀n (S3: 31)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: s’àkutri (H5: 41)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frɤ̀t (D2: 67)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dun’èsəh (D2: 13), fl’àzəhme (K1: 2), p’è̝kəh (V1: 123)
• The present stem is used in the aorist forms and L-participles of some verbs.
            Examples: zberàh (H3: 35), səberàl (K3: 50)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Example: plàtəne (H6: 26), izvàdəš (K2: 78), hàtəme (M1: 158), s’àtəhme (S4: 34)
• Secondary imperfective forms of certain verbs end in -icam instead of expected -ičam.
            Example: ublìcəli (S4: 47)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: dušlìli (H2: 63, D2: 7), reklìli (K3: 40)
• The future particle is zə in all villages except Huhla, where it is še.
            Examples: zə (D1: 42, K1: 3, M2: 4, S1: 4, V1: 28) // še (H6: 93)
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
     Both the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and etymological “ja” behave differently in the two subgroups.
•  Historical Slavic “jat”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group, it always appears as /’a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group it appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/, depending on the nature of the following syllable (that is, as in the standard language), except in aorist verb endings, where it is /e/.
            Examples: s’àme (D1: 42), gul’àmijə (H5: 11) // b’àhə (K1: 40), d’àdu (S4: 33), bèše (K1: 12).
            Example of aorist form: umr’è (M1: 54)
   Within the northern group, the front vowel that appears before palatalizing environment takes different phonetic forms. It is the open vowel /ɛ/ in Stalevo (though sometimes also /e/), but is raised to the more closed vowel /e̝/ in the other villages.
            Examples: : sm’ɛ̀n’əš (S1: 173), p’ɛ̀j (S1: 146) //  jədèše (S2: 73) // pusè̝iš (K1: 84)
    Finally, “jat” appears as /a/ after the /c/ in both the northern and southern groups.
            Examples: càl’ (H1: 81; M1: 192; V2: 14)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group these always appear as /a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group they appear   either as the back vowel /a/ or the open front vowel /ɛ/ depending on the nature of the following syllable (except after /j/, where the result is always /a/).
            Examples: teč’àš’e (D1: 84), uč’àhne (H2: 78) // issušàvə (S2: 51), nədnič’ɛret (M1: 184), uvəž’ɛvəhə (M1: 34), dərž’ɛ̀vi (S2: 88) // jàdenetu (M1: 113), vijàl’ki (M1: 238)
• The northern (Haskovo) group presents an interesting set of changes implementing what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift.
      First, the vowel /e/ is frequently raised to /e̝/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: sè̝lu (K1: 19), b’è̝hme (S1: 70), dvè̝ (V2: 34)
      Second, the high vowel /i/ is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: burɨ̀lu (K2: 77), vərtɨ̀ (M1: 233), bərdɨ̀lu (S1: 143), ugurɨ̀š (V1: 120)
      This chain shift continued, but only in Stalevo, with an occasional retraction of /ɤ/ to /ʌ/.
            Examples: gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3), jədʌ̀t (S2: 3)
 
Morphology
        The following traits are characteristic of the southern (Ivajlovgrad) dialect group.
• The 1st person plural ending /-ne/ for all tenses.
            Examples: klàvəne (D1: 49), glubine (H2: 64) // hrànehne (D1: 49), b’àhne (H6: 32) // stòrihne (H6: 30)
• Instances, albeit infrequent, of 1st person singular present tense endings characteristic of Rhodope dialects, namely /-m/ in verbs of the 1st and 2nd conjugations, and /-a/ in prefixed verbs of the 3rd conjugation.
            Examples: trɤ̀s’em (D2: 68), č’ètəm (H2: 67) // zàčukə (H6: 56)
• The future-in-the-past tense is formed with the future particle and the imperfect form of the verb.
            Example: še ìməše (H3: 46)

"Kovačevo","10011","Sandanski","WESTERN RUPIC: Goce Delčev
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the westernmost portion of Rupic includes a number of quite distinct dialect groups, among which is the dialect of Kovačevo. The administrative affiliation of the village of Kovačevo is with Sandanski, which is located in the Southwestern dialect group; yet the dialect of Kovačevo is undoubtedly an eastern dialect, as seen by its basic vowel features discussed below. There are a very few features which connect it to southwestern dialects (one of these is the future particle), but too few to even call the Kovačevo dialect transitional to the southwestern group. Rather, because it shares so many features of the Goce Delčev dialect as described in the classic work of Kiril Mirčev (1936), to which references are made in this list below), it will be grouped with this dialect.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Kovačevo dialect. It is based on the speech of that villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts, and with references to Mirčev 1936.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kovačevo 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.

"Godeševo","10010","Goce Delčev","WESTERN RUPIC: Čeč (Godeševo, Kruševo, Oreše)
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the westernmost portion of Rupic includes a number of quite distinct dialect groups, among which is the “Čeč dialect”. This dialect is represented on this site by three villages, Kruševo, Oreše, and Godeševo. According to the dialect map created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language (http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/), all three are constituent members of this group. All three belong to the administrative region of Goce Delčev and all three are located relatively close to the town of Goce Delčev. Linguistically, however, they are quite distinct from the dialect of Goce Delčev, both as described in the classical work of Kiril Mirčev (Mirčev 1936) and as exemplified by the village Kovačevo on this website. It is therefore correct to place them in the Čeč dialect group rather than the Goce Delčev one.
            There are also significant differences within the Čeč group between the dialect of Godeševo on the one hand and that of Kruševo and Oreše on the other: the former shares a number of traits with Rhodope dialects whereas the latter are transitional between the Čeč and Goce Delčev dialect groups. Nevertheless, because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the dialect of Godeševo, Kruševo and Oreše. It is based on the speech of these three village as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above (O = Oreše); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kruševo 1, G2 = Godeševo 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.

            Example: Examples: vòdə (K3: 155), r’èkətə (K4: 109), žèni (K1: 62) // m’èsu (K4: 28), d’ètetu (K2: 12), d’àtetu (G2: 2)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
            Examples: pòkəžə (K3: 21), òdnesàm (K21: 59) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative.
            Examples: dònesi (K1: 16), kùtni (K3: 131) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
 
Morphology
 • The plural ending for the feminine nouns rɤka  ‘arm’ and noga  ‘leg’ is /-i/, rather than the ending /-e/ (a continuation of the old dual ending, found in the standard language and many dialects).
            Examples: rəkə̀jte (G3: 11), nugìte (G1: 9), nògi (K3: 133)
• The plural of masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ərgàte (K4: 59), burkàne (K4: 114), pərcàl’e (G2: 4)
• The definite article for masculine nouns is /-o/ if stressed and /-ə/ if unstressed.
            Examples: stanò (K3: 18), čəsò (K4: 18, G1: 9) // kəzàn’ə (K3: 158)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is /-o/, which is the result of the the historical Slavic “back nasal”.
            Example: zem’òtə (O: 41) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
      Such forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, as in most eastern dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative form ending in /-a/ as their single form).
• The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà (K1: 9), jàz (K1: 98), jà (G4: 18)
            1st plural nominative n’è (O: 43)
            3rd plural dative short form mi (K1: 44)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-n-/, respectively.
            Examples: sàa pròl’et (K3: 158), sàə (G3: 20) // tvà (G1: 10)
• The ending of 1st person plural present tense forms for prefixed verbs of all conjugations is either /-m/ or /-a/ (unstressed /-ə/); for unprefixed verbs it is always /-a/ if stressed and /-ə/ if unstressed.
            Examples: ìskaràm (K1: 9), òdnesàm (K1: 59) // òdnesə (K1: 56), ìzberə (K1: 55) // pràv’ə (K1: 61), žìv’ə (K1: 102), stòpl’ə (K2: 29) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Example: dòjdəhme (K3: 163) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• Intransitive verbs can be used transitively.
            Example: še gi nəl’àgəme (G1: 8)  [no examples in Kruševo or Oreše texts]
• Only the pronoun kakɤv and its derivatives are used with adjectival function, and never the pronoun koj.
            Example: nèkvi žèni (K12: 62) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frèt (K4: 79) [no examples in Godeševo texts]
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
The historical Slavic vowels “jat”, front nasal, and front “jer”, and the sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” behave differently in the two subgroups.
• Historical Slavic “jat”. It appears in stressed syllables as /e/ in Kruševo and Oreše, but as /’a/ in Godeševo. In both regions it appears as /a/ after the consonant /c/.
            Examples: m’èsec (K2: 10), izl’èlu (K1: 97), uts’èkəde (K1: 43) // s’ànkətə (G1: 15), d’àtetu (G2: 2), gul’àmi (G2: 8) // càl’ (K2: 10)
    This is one of the traits differentiating Čec from the dialect of Goce Delčev, where it appears as in the standard language.
• Historical Slavic front nasal and front “jer”. In Kruševo and Oreše these appear in stressed syllables as /e/ (with the front jer sometimes as /ɤ/), while in Godeševo they appear as /’o/ (i.e. /o/ with softening of the preceding consonant), though with certain exceptions.
            Example of “front jer”: tèničku (K1: 42), t’èvnu (K4: 13) / ž’ɤ̀neme (K4: 13) // ž’òneš (G1: 14) / dèn (G2: 4)
            Examples of  “front nasal”: izgl’èdələ (K1: 27), m’èsu (K4: 28), odm’èkne (K4: 47) // guv’òttə (G1: 19), izgl’òdəli (G2: 7)
    The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is a basic Rhodope feature, and one of the primary features differentiating the dialect of Godeševo from that of Kruševo and Oreše.
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In Kruševo and Oreše they appear as /a/ after /j/, and as /ɛ/ after post-alveolar consonants, whereas in Godeševo they always appear as /a/.
            Examples: bəjàčkə (K1: 43), jàdene (K1: 58), bìblijàtə (O: 60) // struš’ɛ̀vəše (K4: 62), publəž’ɛ̀və (K1: 44) // ja (G4: 18)
• Early South Slavic syllabic /ṛ/.  It appears as /ɤr/ in Kruševo but as /or/ in Godeševo.
            Examples: mɤ̀rdə (K3: 148), zəmɤ̀rzne (K1: 4) // zəmòrknuvà (G1: 16)
• Only in Kruševo, the sequence /str/ is simplified to /sr/.
            Example: srìži (K3: 122)
• Only in Godeševo, the vowel /e/ is raised in stressed syllables.
            Examples: izmet’è̝ (G1: 4), jədè̝m (G1: 8)
• Only in Godeševo, the high vowels /i/ and /u/ are replaced in stressed syllables by /əj/ and /əw/, respectively.
            Examples of /i/: svərə̀j (G1: 4), nə̀jvətə (G1: 6)
            Examples of /u/: kə̀wp (G3: 11), kə̀wpifmè (G3: 17)
 
Morphology
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns, and feminine plural nouns ending in /-e/, is /-to/ in Kruševo but /-te/ in Godeševo.
            Examples: kumpìretu (K1: 9), sìnuvètu (K1: 110) // ufcètu (K3: 110) // snòpete (G4: 3)
• Only in Kruševo, early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected form of L-participles.
            Example: vl’ezəli (K1: 50).
• Only in Kruševo, the complementizer da is frequently dropped in the negative future and future-in-the-past tenses.
            Examples: štèše fl’èzə (K3: 19), n’èmə mòž’em (K3: 108)

"Drabišna ","10009","Ivajlovgrad","EASTERN RUPIC: Thrace
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Thracian dialect group as such is not completely coterminous with the geographical region called Thrace; at the same time parts of the eastern Rhodopes are within this group. Thracian dialects are spoken in the valley of the river Marica and to the south of it, and to the northeast of it in the direction of Burgas. There are two sub-groups, northern and southern, which are separated by the river Arda (Bojadžiev 1991: 33). The northern group is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Haskovo: Kralevo (K), Malevo (M), Stalevo (S), Vŭglarovo (V). The southern group is represented by two villages from the region of Ivajlovgrad, Drabishna (D) and Huhla (H). Because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Thracian dialect. It is based on the speech of the six villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kralevo 1, D2 = Drabišna 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Haskovo region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Hsk.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears regularly as /e/.
            Examples: t’ènku (H2: 105; S4: 56), žènəlu (M1: 192), dl’ègi (K1: 47)
• The historical Slavic nasal vowels appear as in the standard language: /ɤ/ for the back nasal and /e/ for the front nasal, including after post-alveolar consonants. The only exception (the only evidence of the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals”) is the word for ‘handful’.
            Examples for back nasal: pɤ̀ti (H5: 25), rɤ̀kə (V2: 44)
            Examples for front nasal: ž’ètvə (D4: 4, M1: 184), š’ètəm (H2: 43) //: šɤ̀pkə (D2: 13)
      Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and the historical sequences and “post-alveolar + a”. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. The change is especially common after post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: bỳvə (H1: 31), ut’ùəm (D1: 32), ž’uv̀è̝j (M2: 113), č’uvìjki (V2: 86)

            Examples: nd’àl’ə (H5: 22), dumàtentu (D1: 43), mlàtte (K2: 99), žəlzàtə (V2: 97)
   If the consonant preceding this loss is a sonorant, it is sometimes lengthened; this change has been called “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: stàr:te (M1: 33), r’ətè̝n:tu (S1: 62)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before an initial stressed /e/.
            Examples: jèdru (H3: 51), jètərvi (S1: 10)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cɤr/.
            Example: cɤ̀rn (H1: 22)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions; it is sometimes lost, without any apparent systemic rule.  
            Examples: b’àhə (K1: 40), bè̝hme (M1: 108), l’ahə (V2: 53) // l’abə (K2: 10), rànili (H6: 74), izgl’èdəə (D1: 15)
• In word-initial position, the consonant /f/ is replaced by /h/.
            Examples: hučì (s2: 3), hùrni (V1: 54), h udəìte (D1: 50)

            Examples: velìgden’ (D2: 29), həmbàr’ (M1: 254), rudàn’ (S1: 65), dè̝vet’ (V2: 56), žuòt’ (K1: 73)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: jàbəl’k’i (D2: 82), vijàl’ki (M1: 238), mɤ̀l’čə (V2: 122)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dòrə (D2: 138), tòjtu (H3: 51), duòl’ni (K1: 11), utòri (S1: 169), òlvet (V2: 38)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: pànnələ (D2: 162), nəpànnəli (K3: 63), s’è̝nnem (V2: 127)
• The sequences /bn/ and /vn/ are assimilated to /mn/.
            Examples: drèmničku (D1: 42), drèmnu (H3: 52), gràmnəd (K2: 51), ràmnu (H4: 5)
• The initial sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/.
            Examples: mlògu (H2: 43, M2: 77, V1: 100)
• The sequence /str/ is replaced by /sr/.
            Examples: srìgələ (S1: 13), srùnkə (V1: 6), nəsɤ̀rgənə (H1: 17)

            Examples: stuv’ɤ̀t (H6: 15), dvìme (K2: 58), duv’àhne (H4: 34)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: l’àhə (V2: 53), nògə (d1: 23), čòrbə (S2: (74), dɤ̀ski (M1: 253), sèsri (V1: 74) // bràšnu (V1: 123), mòmč’etə (D1: 68), t’èletə (M2: 102)

• The accent is retracted to the initial syllble in imperative forms.
            Examples: s’enni (D2: 98), kàž’te (H1: 4), zàmesɨ (M1: 265), sùrni (S1: 107) vɤ̀rši (V2: 24)
 
Morphology
• The masculine plural ending is /-e/.
            Examples: kòkəle (D2: 177), prof’èsure (K2: 83), dòkture (S2: 11)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: udɤ̀tə (D1: 84), vujnɤ̀ (H6: 62), žinɤ̀tə (K1: 18), gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for “arm” and “leg” is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rəkìti (M2: 39), nugì (H3: 47)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Examples: səjvànetu (D1: 84), kəlàmetu̥ (S1: 112), òluvetu (V2: 98), ubòretu (H3: 34)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (K1: 16), jàs (D1: 39); the first form is more frequent.
            3rd singular nominative neuter: tòj (D2: 72, K2: 74)
            3rd singular accusative masculine: n’ègə (K3: 43)
            3rd singular accusative feminine: nèhi (S4: 48)
            3rd plural accusative short form: hi (D1: 93), i (D2: 57)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (M1: 113), hni (S4: 40)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Examples: sòo (D1: 50), svà (K1: 2), tvà (S1: 117, D1: 4; K3: 8), nvà (H3: 52)
• The pronoun “kakǔv” and its derivatives are used instead of “koj” in adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkəv dèn’ (H3: 31), n’àkəf pɤ̀t (K2: 92; M1: 190), n’àkəv drɤ̀n (S3: 31)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: s’àkutri (H5: 41)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frɤ̀t (D2: 67)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dun’èsəh (D2: 13), fl’àzəhme (K1: 2), p’è̝kəh (V1: 123)
• The present stem is used in the aorist forms and L-participles of some verbs.
            Examples: zberàh (H3: 35), səberàl (K3: 50)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Example: plàtəne (H6: 26), izvàdəš (K2: 78), hàtəme (M1: 158), s’àtəhme (S4: 34)
• Secondary imperfective forms of certain verbs end in -icam instead of expected -ičam.
            Example: ublìcəli (S4: 47)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: dušlìli (H2: 63, D2: 7), reklìli (K3: 40)
• The future particle is zə in all villages except Huhla, where it is še.
            Examples: zə (D1: 42, K1: 3, M2: 4, S1: 4, V1: 28) // še (H6: 93)
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
     Both the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and etymological “ja” behave differently in the two subgroups.
•  Historical Slavic “jat”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group, it always appears as /’a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group it appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/, depending on the nature of the following syllable (that is, as in the standard language), except in aorist verb endings, where it is /e/.
            Examples: s’àme (D1: 42), gul’àmijə (H5: 11) // b’àhə (K1: 40), d’àdu (S4: 33), bèše (K1: 12).
            Example of aorist form: umr’è (M1: 54)
   Within the northern group, the front vowel that appears before palatalizing environment takes different phonetic forms. It is the open vowel /ɛ/ in Stalevo (though sometimes also /e/), but is raised to the more closed vowel /e̝/ in the other villages.
            Examples: : sm’ɛ̀n’əš (S1: 173), p’ɛ̀j (S1: 146) //  jədèše (S2: 73) // pusè̝iš (K1: 84)
    Finally, “jat” appears as /a/ after the /c/ in both the northern and southern groups.
            Examples: càl’ (H1: 81; M1: 192; V2: 14)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group these always appear as /a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group they appear   either as the back vowel /a/ or the open front vowel /ɛ/ depending on the nature of the following syllable (except after /j/, where the result is always /a/).
            Examples: teč’àš’e (D1: 84), uč’àhne (H2: 78) // issušàvə (S2: 51), nədnič’ɛret (M1: 184), uvəž’ɛvəhə (M1: 34), dərž’ɛ̀vi (S2: 88) // jàdenetu (M1: 113), vijàl’ki (M1: 238)
• The northern (Haskovo) group presents an interesting set of changes implementing what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift.
      First, the vowel /e/ is frequently raised to /e̝/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: sè̝lu (K1: 19), b’è̝hme (S1: 70), dvè̝ (V2: 34)
      Second, the high vowel /i/ is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: burɨ̀lu (K2: 77), vərtɨ̀ (M1: 233), bərdɨ̀lu (S1: 143), ugurɨ̀š (V1: 120)
      This chain shift continued, but only in Stalevo, with an occasional retraction of /ɤ/ to /ʌ/.
            Examples: gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3), jədʌ̀t (S2: 3)
 
Morphology
        The following traits are characteristic of the southern (Ivajlovgrad) dialect group.
• The 1st person plural ending /-ne/ for all tenses.
            Examples: klàvəne (D1: 49), glubine (H2: 64) // hrànehne (D1: 49), b’àhne (H6: 32) // stòrihne (H6: 30)
• Instances, albeit infrequent, of 1st person singular present tense endings characteristic of Rhodope dialects, namely /-m/ in verbs of the 1st and 2nd conjugations, and /-a/ in prefixed verbs of the 3rd conjugation.
            Examples: trɤ̀s’em (D2: 68), č’ètəm (H2: 67) // zàčukə (H6: 56)
• The future-in-the-past tense is formed with the future particle and the imperfect form of the verb.
            Example: še ìməše (H3: 46)

"Dolno Ujno","10008","Kjustendil","SOUTHWESTERN: Kjustendil
            The Kjustendil dialect is represented on the website by two villages, Dolno Ujno (DU) and Eremija (E). They are clearly part of the same overall dialect group, yet they differ from each other in certain specific ways. This accords with the statements made in the major published source about the Kjustendil dialect group (Umlenski 1965), which distinguishes the dialect of Kjustendil proper from three other transitional dialects that are spoken in the general region: the Pijanec dialect to the south, the Kamenica dialect to the west, and the Kraište dialect to the north, and which places the village of Dolno Unjo within the northern, Kraište sub-dialect and Eremija within the southern, Pijanec sub-dialect (Umlenski 1965: 7). Accordingly, the two villages are described here together as part of the single larger Kjustendil dialect, with attention to the few traits distinguishing them from one another.

            Examples: nèkade (E1: 97), lèto (E1: 108), zavalè (E1: 126), dèdo (DU: 20)
• The result of the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” is one of the traits differentiating the two sub-dialects: it appears in root syllables as /a/ in Eremija and /ɤ/ in Dolno Ujno; in verbal endings it is /a/ in both villages.
            Examples: (root) màtna (E1: 123), stàpiš (E3: 19); (ending) donesàt (E1:114) // (root) pɤ̀t (DU: 27), kɤ̀šta (DU: 164); (ending) sedàt (DU: 206)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back jer” always appears as /o/.
            Examples: dòždo (E1: 126), dànoci (E1: 55), nèkakof (E2: 16)
• The early South Slavic syllabic /r/ usually remains unchanged in both dialects, though it sometimes occurs as /ɤr/ or /ər/.
            Examples: četvṛ̀to (E1: 4), vṛštàn’e (E1: 95); vṛ̀že (DU 62) // dərvò (E6: 19), bɤ̀rdo (DU 119)

            Examples: pɤ̀lni (DU: 72), vḷ̀nata (DU: 62) // vùcite (E5: 105), muzàli (E5: 116);
    It must be noted, however, that in all examples the sequence is preceded by a labial consonant.
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cṛ/ or /cɤr/.
            Examples: cɤrvèna (E1: 12), cṛnìcata (E4: 50)
• Except in past tense verbal endings, the consonant /x/ is either lost, or replaced by /j/ after the vowel /e/.
            Examples: òro (DU: 237), lèbec (E3: 36), sùa (E2: 29) // lejà (E1: 132).
• The behavior of /x/ in past tense verbal endings is more complex. In position before a consonant it can either be preserved, replaced by /j/ or lost. Intervocalically it is always lost.
            Examples: ostarèxme (E1: 21), posadìjme (E1: 126), izvadìme (E2: 37) // zapišàa (E1: 68)
• Early South Slavic “epenthetic /l/” is preserved.
            Example: opràvl’at (DU: 307)
• Soft consonants occur rarely, and never in masculine definite forms or in verbal endings (contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects).
            Example: nablàžnat (DU: 12)
     In fact, only /k/, /g/, /l/, and /n/ have soft correlates at all.
• The sequence /mn/ is replaced by /ml/ or /n/ word-initially or by /vn/ in other positions.
            Examples: mlògo (E3: 4), nògu (E4: 25), gùvna (E6: 16)
• Soft /k’/ is ocasionally replaced by /č/.
            Examples: čeremìdite (E4: 46), dičèla (E5: 38)
• The sequence /sr/ is sporadically replaced by /str/.
            Example: stredàta (E6: 45).
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: vòda (E1: 55), rèka (E6: 91), kòzi (E1: 88), òfci (E1: 88), bràšno (E3: 62), òro (DU: 237)
• The accent is shifted to the ending of some polysyllabic masculine nouns.
            Examples: bunarjè (E1: 119), soborjè (DU: 215)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2d conjugation verbs.
            Examples: jàviš (E1: 12), kòrat (E5: 15)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in first singular forms of the present tense, but only in Eremija.
            Examples: dònesa (E1: 22), pòdmesa (E3: 61) // napràim (DU 47)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in the imperative forms.
            Examples: zàpoznaj (E1: 30), òtsej (E3: 62), màni (DU 25)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles, including those with syllabic prefixes.
            Examples: uplašìx (E1: 51), presənàl (E1: 121)
 
Morphology
- The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà (E1: 64), jàzeka (E5: 34)
            2nd singular nominative tìzeka (E1: 150)
            3rd singular nominative òn (E4: 44), onà (E1: 101), onò (N1: 124)
            3rd plural nominative onì (E4: 7)
            3rd plural accusative nìx (E2: 13)

"Mogilica","9988","Smoljan","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Smoljan - Široka Lŭka
            The Rhodope dialects occupy the central geographical portion of the Rupic area. Rhodope dialects are also “central Rupic” in that many of the characteristic Rupic features (such as the accent retraction in disyllabic feminine nouns) are most consistently implemented in them. The existence of the Rhodope dialect as a distinct group was first asserted by Ljubomir Miletič (Miletich 1912). Since then, the Rhodope region has become quite well known, and not just for its characteristic dialect. The colorful local folklore, and the imposing mountain scenery have also attracted a great deal of attention.
            This site includes villages representing six different subgroups of Rhodope dialects, two of which are characterized by the features outlined below. One is the Smoljan dialect group, which is the most important and widespread Rhodope dialect (Stojkov 1993: 129), and which is represented on the website by the villages Čokmanovo (Č), Mogilica (Mg), and Momčilovci (Mm). The other is the dialect of Široka Lŭka, represented on the website by the villages Gela (G), Široka Lŭka (ŠL), Stikŭl (Sk), and Stojkite (St). This dialect, which constitutes an island within the Smoljan dialect, is invariably mentioned in the literature as a separate dialect. But since the features common to the two groups far outnumber the differences, we group them together here, noting the few differences at the end.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Smoljan-Široka Lǔka dialect. It is based on the speech of the seven locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Mm = Momčilovci); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. G1 = Gela 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat”  appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  with the exception of the word meaning ‘entire’, where it appears as /a/.
            Examples: nid’ɛ̀l’ə  (Č1: 22), mɛ̀stu  (Mg1: 50), c’ɛ̀pət  (Mm: 7), l’ɛ̀tnu  (G3: 62), dɛ̀du  (ŠL: 39), gulɛ̀m  (Sk3: 25), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16) // càl’  (Mm: 22), càl’  (G2: 66)
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”,  namely /ɛ/  in stressed syllables.
            Examples: ž’ɛ̀lku  (Č1: 9), kuč’ɛ̀n  (Mg3: 63), č’ɛ̀kə  (Mm: 14), jɛ̀gn’at  (G3: 46),   čɛ̀kame  (ŠL: 14), tujɛ̀škə  (Sk4: 64), šɛ̀fer  (St1: 2)
    The common result of these two major historical vowels is one of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletich 1912: 29).
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as a half-open back rounded vowel /ɔ/. See below, however, for the result of back nasal + liquid.
               Examples of back “jer”:  dɔ̀š  (Č2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 109), rɔ̀žen  (G2: 29), isɔ̀hne (St1: 22)
               Examples of back nasal:  gɔ̀bi  (Č2: 1), kɔ̀šti  (Mg1: 54), mɔ̀čət  (G1: 35), pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), skɔ̀pi  (Sk2: 26)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as  a half-open back rounded vowel /’ɔ/,  i.e. with softening of the preceding consonant, though with exceptions in certain frequently used words. The most notable of these are the words for ‘day and ‘five’.
               Examples of front “jer”:  z’ɔ̀meš  (Mg6: 6), ž’ɔ̀nehme  (Č2: 14), z’ɔ̀me  (G2: 7) // d’èn’ə  (Č1: 1), dèn’  (G2: 93);
               Examples of front nasal: l’ɔ̀štə  (Č2: 15), pr’ɔ̀lutu  (Mg1: 34), najɔ̀dru  (Mg2: 14), gl’ɔ̀dɤm  (G3: 50), č’ɔ̀stu  (St1: 24) // p’et  (Mg1: 13), pèd  (G1: 14)
     The merger of these four classic historical Slavic vowels (both jers and both nasals) – with the proviso that consonant softening distinguishes the two “front” vowels from the two “back” ones – is another of the principal features cited by Miletič as characteristic of Rhodope dialects (Miletič 1912: 29).
     Indeed there is another feature distinguishing the reflexes of these specific back and front vowels: their participation in different vowel alternations. In unstressed syllables the result of the two back vowels alternates with reduced a, and the result of the two front vowels alternates with e.
               Examples of back vowels: istəkàta  (G2: 17), dəšterì  (Mm: 4); məž’uvète  (Č1: 33), mažɔ̀n  (G2: 11), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
               Examples of front vowels: zemàhə  (Mg3: 91); nared’ɔ̀t  (G2: 37), ispredèš  (Mg1: 34)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as /ɔr/ and  /ɔl/. 
               Examples: tɔ̀rnəhə  (Č1: 33), sɔ̀rp  (Mg3: 27), vɔ̀rhlə  (Mm: 6), pɔ̀lnumàlu  (Č1: 13), izmɔ̀rznət  (G2: 13), pɔ̀rs  (Sl2: 78)
     Here it should be noted that the sequence of liquid and back nasal did not merge with the syllabic liquids.
               Examples: putrɔ̀sə  (Sk2: 35), kragɔ̀n  (St2: 15)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ before a labial consonant; this occurs especially frequently after post-alveolar consonants.
               Examples: l’uvàtkite  (Č1: 1), žuvèeme  (G3: 54), sèt’uf  (Sk4: 3)
• Unstressed vowel are frequently lost.
               Examples: ràptətə  (Č1: 5), tvàr  (Mm: 16), zvɛ̀hme  (G2: 36), zdɛ̀nki  (ŠL: 17), z’ɔ̀mte  (Sk2: 56)
• The consonant /x/  in replaced by /h/  in all positions, with very few exceptions.
               Examples: hòru  (Č1: 1), hòd’əm  (Sl2: 35)// sèt’uf  (Sl4: 3)
• The voiced affricate /dž/  is replaced by /ž/.
               Examples: bəžɛ̀  (Č1: 29), bəžɛ̀ci  (Mg1: 47)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
               Examples: wògən’  (Č1: 29), živòt’  (Mm: 12), dèn’  (G2: 93), kòn’  (ŠL: 23)
• The consonant /l/  is palatalized before soft consonants.
               Examples: šìkəl’ki  (Č1: 19), šušùl’ki  (G1: 62)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurrence of double accent, especially in the Široka Lŭka group.
               Examples: càrevìcə  (Č1: 25), drùgučɛ̀šen  (G2: 3), sàdɤmè gu  (ŠL: 13), mòmčencètu ( Sl3: 89), bàbicìse  (St1: 24)
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
               Examples: vòda  (ŠL: 25), žènise  (G2: 1), dɔ̀ski  (Mg1: 101), rɔ̀ki  (Mg3: 112); bràšnu  (G2: 36), tɛ̀stu  (St2: 16), m’ɔ̀su  (Č2: 8), dɛ̀te  (Mg1: 81)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense forms.
               Examples: prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105), ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am       (G1: 16),  òčist’ə  (Sl2: 70)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
               Examples: kàzite (G3: 4),  z’ɔ̀mte (Sl2: 56)
• The past tense forms of the verb ‘be’ are unaccented.
               Examples: be jɛ̀ce trùdno  (Č2: 14), beše tɛ̀sen  (Mg6: 71), be dušlà  (G2: 94), be letɛ̀lu  (Sk2: 38)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
               Examples: suhàrje  (Č1: 28), čuvàl:e  (Mg3: 30), gajtàne  (G2: 21), ufč’ɛ̀re  (Sk3: 150)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɔ/.
               Examples: zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), zimɔ̀tə  (Mm: 23), gulik’ɔ̀  (G2: 21), serɔ̀  (Sk2: 127)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• Feminine nouns ending in consonant have shifted to the masculine gender. 
               Examples: pepelɔ̀n  (Mg6: 27), žərɔ̀n  (Mg6: 22), večerɔ̀s  (Sl1: 95)
• There are separate dative plural forms for adjectives and pronouns.
            Examples: čùzdim  (Mm: 6), vrìtem  (Mg4: 25), stàr:tem  (Sk1: 31)
    This, the preservation of old case forms, is the third of four traits upon which Miletič based his original definition of the Rhodope dialect.
• The final of the four traits upon which Miletič’s claim of the specificity of Rhodope dialects rests is the existence of the tripartite definite article, with different forms indicating whether the speaker focuses on proximity, distance, or chooses not to emphasize either of these options. The Rhodope dialects are the primary locale of this trait in Bulgarian, though it is also found in the Trŭn dialect, where the formant /-v-/  marks the “proximal” form. In the Rhodopes the proximal form is marked by the formant /-s-/. The neutral (=”medial”) and “distal” forms are marked in both regions by /-t-/  and /-n-/, respectively.
               Examples: bàbise  (Č1: 4), dɔ̀skise  (Mg1: 105), zem’ɔ̀nə  (Č2: 5), ledùnkisɤ  (G1: 52), kràvɤte  (G1: 38), garbɔ̀n  (G2: 6)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/  (with proximal and distal forms in /-so/  and /-no/,  respectively.
               Examples: baìretu  (G3: 42), snòpenu  (St2: 7)
• The tripartite article invariably implies a tripartite system of demonstrative pronouns.
               Examples: s’ɛ̀ə  (Mm: 9),  tvà  (Mg1: 105), nàa  (Mm: 40), svà  (G1: 52), tuvà  (G1: 26), nvà  (G2: 71)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
               1st singular nominative: jɛ̀  (Mg4: 26, G2: 4)
               3rd singular dative feminine short form: hi  (Mg3: 110)
               3rd singular accusative masculine short form: ga  (G2: 13)
               3rd plural dative short form hmi  (Mm: 7), (G3: 41)
• The 1st singular present tense ending is /-m/  for unprefixed verbs, and either  /-a/  or /-ə/  for prefixed verbs (except for Mogilica, where all verbs have the ending /-m/).
               Examples: ràbut’əm  (Mm: 20), pòvn’am  (G1: 16), hòd’əm  (Sk2: 35); nàmaža  (St2: 14), òčist’ə  (Sk2: 70) //  prèdəm  (Mg1: 8), ìzdujəm  (Mg3: 105).
• The ending for 3rd person plural present tense can appear with or without the final /-t./
               Examples: plət’ɔ̀t  (Mm: 14), vərhɔ̀t  (Mg3: 3), jədɔ̀t  (Sk2: 64) // dədɔ̀  (Mm: 14), vərv’ɔ̀  (Sk2: 22), svər’ɔ̀  (Sk3:78)
• The plural imperative ending is /-ite/.
               Example: kàžite  (G3: 4)
• The future particle is žə  or že.
               Examples: žə gu prumenɤ̀  (G1: 4), žə ìštət  (Sk4: 21), že rukɔ̀t  (Č1: 10)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: kutrì (Sk2: 114))
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Examples: vrìt  (M3: 47, M4: 6), vrìtem  (M4: 25)
• The interrogative pronoun “kina” is used in place of “kakvo”.
               Example: kənà  (M2: 7)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
               Example: bəlìli  (Sk 3: 161)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-t/.
               Examples: umrɛ̀ti  (Mg4: 4), istəkàta  (G2: 17), kupàtu  (Sk3: 6)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
               Examples: zəfàtə  (Mg3: 2), nəhòdəhme  (Č2: 1), ràdat  (G3: 43), plàta  (Sk4: 34)
 
SPECIFIC COMMENTARY
       The dialect of Široka Lŭka is characterized by three additional traits:
• Unstressed /e/  and /i/  are replaced by /ə/  and /ɤ/   respectively.
               Examples: urɛ̀hmə  (G1: 48), zəfàtəmə ( G1: 36); kràvɤ  (G1: 62), gɔ̀bɤte  (G2: 25)
• Soft /t’/  and /d’/  are replaced by soft /k’/  and /d’/.
               Examples: pɔ̀k’an  (St1: 25), pèk’  (Sk4: 46), duvègena  (ŠL: 44), dàg’ena  (Sk4: 37)
• As opposed to other Rupic dialects, where the aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/, this replacement fails to occur.
               Examples:  rèku  (G1: 54),  dàduhə  (Sk1: 66), izlɛ̀zuhə  (Sk3: 27), utìduh  (St1: 12) // flèzəhme  (Mg3: 114).
• Finally, the dialect of Mogilica, inhabited entirely by Bulgarian Muslims, is additionally characterized by the phenomenon called “akavism”: the replacement of unstressed /o/  by underlying /a/  (pronounced as [ə]).
               Examples: gəlɛ̀mi  (Mg2: 6), dəjɛ̀čkə  (Mg3: 113)

"Eremija","9906","Kjustendil","SOUTHWESTERN: Kjustendil
            The Kjustendil dialect is represented on the website by two villages, Dolno Ujno (DU) and Eremija (E). They are clearly part of the same overall dialect group, yet they differ from each other in certain specific ways. This accords with the statements made in the major published source about the Kjustendil dialect group (Umlenski 1965), which distinguishes the dialect of Kjustendil proper from three other transitional dialects that are spoken in the general region: the Pijanec dialect to the south, the Kamenica dialect to the west, and the Kraište dialect to the north, and which places the village of Dolno Unjo within the northern, Kraište sub-dialect and Eremija within the southern, Pijanec sub-dialect (Umlenski 1965: 7). Accordingly, the two villages are described here together as part of the single larger Kjustendil dialect, with attention to the few traits distinguishing them from one another.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Kjustendil  dialect group. It is based on the speech of the two villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village, if there is more than one (e.g. E1 = Eremija 1) or simply the village (DU = Dolno Ujno), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: nèkade (E1: 97), lèto (E1: 108), zavalè (E1: 126), dèdo (DU: 20)
• The result of the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” is one of the traits differentiating the two sub-dialects: it appears in root syllables as /a/ in Eremija and /ɤ/ in Dolno Ujno; in verbal endings it is /a/ in both villages.
            Examples: (root) màtna (E1: 123), stàpiš (E3: 19); (ending) donesàt (E1:114) // (root) pɤ̀t (DU: 27), kɤ̀šta (DU: 164); (ending) sedàt (DU: 206)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back jer” always appears as /o/.
            Examples: dòždo (E1: 126), dànoci (E1: 55), nèkakof (E2: 16)
• The early South Slavic syllabic /r/ usually remains unchanged in both dialects, though it sometimes occurs as /ɤr/ or /ər/.
            Examples: četvṛ̀to (E1: 4), vṛštàn’e (E1: 95); vṛ̀že (DU 62) // dərvò (E6: 19), bɤ̀rdo (DU 119)

    It must be noted, however, that in all examples the sequence is preceded by a labial consonant.
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cṛ/ or /cɤr/.
            Examples: cɤrvèna (E1: 12), cṛnìcata (E4: 50)
• Except in past tense verbal endings, the consonant /x/ is either lost, or replaced by /j/ after the vowel /e/.
            Examples: òro (DU: 237), lèbec (E3: 36), sùa (E2: 29) // lejà (E1: 132).
• The behavior of /x/ in past tense verbal endings is more complex. In position before a consonant it can either be preserved, replaced by /j/ or lost. Intervocalically it is always lost.
            Examples: ostarèxme (E1: 21), posadìjme (E1: 126), izvadìme (E2: 37) // zapišàa (E1: 68)
• Early South Slavic “epenthetic /l/” is preserved.
            Example: opràvl’at (DU: 307)
• Soft consonants occur rarely, and never in masculine definite forms or in verbal endings (contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects).
            Example: nablàžnat (DU: 12)
     In fact, only /k/, /g/, /l/, and /n/ have soft correlates at all.
• The sequence /mn/ is replaced by /ml/ or /n/ word-initially or by /vn/ in other positions.

• Soft /k’/ is ocasionally replaced by /č/.
            Examples: čeremìdite (E4: 46), dičèla (E5: 38)
• The sequence /sr/ is sporadically replaced by /str/.
            Example: stredàta (E6: 45).
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: vòda (E1: 55), rèka (E6: 91), kòzi (E1: 88), òfci (E1: 88), bràšno (E3: 62), òro (DU: 237)
• The accent is shifted to the ending of some polysyllabic masculine nouns.
            Examples: bunarjè (E1: 119), soborjè (DU: 215)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many 2d conjugation verbs.
            Examples: jàviš (E1: 12), kòrat (E5: 15)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in first singular forms of the present tense, but only in Eremija.
            Examples: dònesa (E1: 22), pòdmesa (E3: 61) // napràim (DU 47)

Morphology
- The forms of personal pronouns are frequently different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative jà (E1: 64), jàzeka (E5: 34)
            2nd singular nominative tìzeka (E1: 150)

"Malevo/Hsk","8906","Haskovo","EASTERN RUPIC: Thrace
            The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the easternmost portion of Rupic includes two major dialect groups, Thracian and Strandža (Bojadžiev 1991: 20-24). The Thracian dialect group as such is not completely coterminous with the geographical region called Thrace; at the same time parts of the eastern Rhodopes are within this group. Thracian dialects are spoken in the valley of the river Marica and to the south of it, and to the northeast of it in the direction of Burgas. There are two sub-groups, northern and southern, which are separated by the river Arda (Bojadžiev 1991: 33). The northern group is represented on the website by four villages from the region of Haskovo: Kralevo (K), Malevo (M), Stalevo (S), Vŭglarovo (V). The southern group is represented by two villages from the region of Ivajlovgrad, Drabishna (D) and Huhla (H). Because features common to the two groups significantly outnumber the differences, the two groups are described here together. Specific notice is made of the differences.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Thracian dialect. It is based on the speech of the six villages mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kralevo 1, D2 = Drabišna 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Malevo: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Malevo described here is located in the Haskovo region; on the website it is labeled Malevo/Hsk.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears regularly as /e/.
            Examples: t’ènku (H2: 105; S4: 56), žènəlu (M1: 192), dl’ègi (K1: 47)
• The historical Slavic nasal vowels appear as in the standard language: /ɤ/ for the back nasal and /e/ for the front nasal, including after post-alveolar consonants. The only exception (the only evidence of the phenomenon called “mixing of nasals”) is the word for ‘handful’.
            Examples for back nasal: pɤ̀ti (H5: 25), rɤ̀kə (V2: 44)
            Examples for front nasal: ž’ètvə (D4: 4, M1: 184), š’ètəm (H2: 43) //: šɤ̀pkə (D2: 13)
      Most of the differences between the two groups concern the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and the historical sequences and “post-alveolar + a”. These are outlined at the end of the description.
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. The change is especially common after post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: bỳvə (H1: 31), ut’ùəm (D1: 32), ž’uv̀è̝j (M2: 113), č’uvìjki (V2: 86)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: nd’àl’ə (H5: 22), dumàtentu (D1: 43), mlàtte (K2: 99), žəlzàtə (V2: 97)
   If the consonant preceding this loss is a sonorant, it is sometimes lengthened; this change has been called “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: stàr:te (M1: 33), r’ətè̝n:tu (S1: 62)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before an initial stressed /e/.
            Examples: jèdru (H3: 51), jètərvi (S1: 10)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cɤr/.
            Example: cɤ̀rn (H1: 22)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions; it is sometimes lost, without any apparent systemic rule.  
            Examples: b’àhə (K1: 40), bè̝hme (M1: 108), l’ahə (V2: 53) // l’abə (K2: 10), rànili (H6: 74), izgl’èdəə (D1: 15)

            Examples: velìgden’ (D2: 29), həmbàr’ (M1: 254), rudàn’ (S1: 65), dè̝vet’ (V2: 56), žuòt’ (K1: 73)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: jàbəl’k’i (D2: 82), vijàl’ki (M1: 238), mɤ̀l’čə (V2: 122)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dòrə (D2: 138), tòjtu (H3: 51), duòl’ni (K1: 11), utòri (S1: 169), òlvet (V2: 38)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: pànnələ (D2: 162), nəpànnəli (K3: 63), s’è̝nnem (V2: 127)
• The sequences /bn/ and /vn/ are assimilated to /mn/.
            Examples: drèmničku (D1: 42), drèmnu (H3: 52), gràmnəd (K2: 51), ràmnu (H4: 5)
• The initial sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/.
            Examples: mlògu (H2: 43, M2: 77, V1: 100)
• The sequence /str/ is replaced by /sr/.
            Examples: srìgələ (S1: 13), srùnkə (V1: 6), nəsɤ̀rgənə (H1: 17)
• The consonant /j/ is replaced by /v/ after a rounded vowel.
            Examples: stuv’ɤ̀t (H6: 15), dvìme (K2: 58), duv’àhne (H4: 34)
 
Accent
• The accent is regularly retracted in disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: l’àhə (V2: 53), nògə (d1: 23), čòrbə (S2: (74), dɤ̀ski (M1: 253), sèsri (V1: 74) // bràšnu (V1: 123), mòmč’etə (D1: 68), t’èletə (M2: 102)

• The accent is retracted to the initial syllble in imperative forms.
            Examples: s’enni (D2: 98), kàž’te (H1: 4), zàmesɨ (M1: 265), sùrni (S1: 107) vɤ̀rši (V2: 24)
 
Morphology
• The masculine plural ending is /-e/.
            Examples: kòkəle (D2: 177), prof’èsure (K2: 83), dòkture (S2: 11)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: udɤ̀tə (D1: 84), vujnɤ̀ (H6: 62), žinɤ̀tə (K1: 18), gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
• The plural of the words for “arm” and “leg” is formed with the productive ending /-i/  instead of the old dual /-e/.
            Examples: rəkìti (M2: 39), nugì (H3: 47)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Examples: səjvànetu (D1: 84), kəlàmetu̥ (S1: 112), òluvetu (V2: 98), ubòretu (H3: 34)
• The forms of the personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative: jà (K1: 16), jàs (D1: 39); the first form is more frequent.
            3rd singular nominative neuter: tòj (D2: 72, K2: 74)
            3rd singular accusative masculine: n’ègə (K3: 43)
            3rd singular accusative feminine: nèhi (S4: 48)
            3rd plural accusative short form: hi (D1: 93), i (D2: 57)
            3rd plural dative short form: hmi (M1: 113), hni (S4: 40)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-s-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Examples: sòo (D1: 50), svà (K1: 2), tvà (S1: 117, D1: 4; K3: 8), nvà (H3: 52)
• The pronoun “kakǔv” and its derivatives are used instead of “koj” in adjectival function.
            Examples: n’àkəv dèn’ (H3: 31), n’àkəf pɤ̀t (K2: 92; M1: 190), n’àkəv drɤ̀n (S3: 31)
• The interrogative pronoun “kutri” and its derivatives are used in place of “koji”.
            Example: s’àkutri (H5: 41)
• The dialectal form “vrit” in the meaning ‘all’ is frequently found.
            Example: frɤ̀t (D2: 67)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dun’èsəh (D2: 13), fl’àzəhme (K1: 2), p’è̝kəh (V1: 123)
• The present stem is used in the aorist forms and L-participles of some verbs.
            Examples: zberàh (H3: 35), səberàl (K3: 50)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfective of some verbs.
            Example: plàtəne (H6: 26), izvàdəš (K2: 78), hàtəme (M1: 158), s’àtəhme (S4: 34)
• Secondary imperfective forms of certain verbs end in -icam instead of expected -ičam.
            Example: ublìcəli (S4: 47)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111)
• There is reduplication of the morpheme /-l/  in L-participles with stressed endings.
            Examples: dušlìli (H2: 63, D2: 7), reklìli (K3: 40)
• The future particle is zə in all villages except Huhla, where it is še.
            Examples: zə (D1: 42, K1: 3, M2: 4, S1: 4, V1: 28) // še (H6: 93)
 
DIFFERENCES
Phonology
     Both the historical Slavic vowels “jat” and etymological “ja” behave differently in the two subgroups.
•  Historical Slavic “jat”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group, it always appears as /’a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group it appears either as the back vowel /’a/  (with softening of the preceding consonant) or as the front vowel /e/, depending on the nature of the following syllable (that is, as in the standard language), except in aorist verb endings, where it is /e/.
            Examples: s’àme (D1: 42), gul’àmijə (H5: 11) // b’àhə (K1: 40), d’àdu (S4: 33), bèše (K1: 12).
            Example of aorist form: umr’è (M1: 54)
   Within the northern group, the front vowel that appears before palatalizing environment takes different phonetic forms. It is the open vowel /ɛ/ in Stalevo (though sometimes also /e/), but is raised to the more closed vowel /e̝/ in the other villages.
            Examples: : sm’ɛ̀n’əš (S1: 173), p’ɛ̀j (S1: 146) //  jədèše (S2: 73) // pusè̝iš (K1: 84)
    Finally, “jat” appears as /a/ after the /c/ in both the northern and southern groups.
            Examples: càl’ (H1: 81; M1: 192; V2: 14)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a”. In the southern (Ivajlovgrad) group these always appear as /a/, whereas in the northern (Haskovo) group they appear   either as the back vowel /a/ or the open front vowel /ɛ/ depending on the nature of the following syllable (except after /j/, where the result is always /a/).
            Examples: teč’àš’e (D1: 84), uč’àhne (H2: 78) // issušàvə (S2: 51), nədnič’ɛret (M1: 184), uvəž’ɛvəhə (M1: 34), dərž’ɛ̀vi (S2: 88) // jàdenetu (M1: 113), vijàl’ki (M1: 238)
• The northern (Haskovo) group presents an interesting set of changes implementing what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift.
      First, the vowel /e/ is frequently raised to /e̝/ in stressed syllables.
            Examples: sè̝lu (K1: 19), b’è̝hme (S1: 70), dvè̝ (V2: 34)
      Second, the high vowel /i/ is frequently retracted to /ɨ/.
            Examples: burɨ̀lu (K2: 77), vərtɨ̀ (M1: 233), bərdɨ̀lu (S1: 143), ugurɨ̀š (V1: 120)
      This chain shift continued, but only in Stalevo, with an occasional retraction of /ɤ/ to /ʌ/.
            Examples: gləvʌ̀tə (S2: 3), jədʌ̀t (S2: 3)
 
Morphology
        The following traits are characteristic of the southern (Ivajlovgrad) dialect group.
• The 1st person plural ending /-ne/ for all tenses.
            Examples: klàvəne (D1: 49), glubine (H2: 64) // hrànehne (D1: 49), b’àhne (H6: 32) // stòrihne (H6: 30)
• Instances, albeit infrequent, of 1st person singular present tense endings characteristic of Rhodope dialects, namely /-m/ in verbs of the 1st and 2nd conjugations, and /-a/ in prefixed verbs of the 3rd conjugation.
            Examples: trɤ̀s’em (D2: 68), č’ètəm (H2: 67) // zàčukə (H6: 56)
• The future-in-the-past tense is formed with the future particle and the imperfect form of the verb.
            Example: še ìməše (H3: 46)

"Markovo","7899","Čirpan","NORTHEASTERN: Sub-Balkan
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the sub-Balkan variety is represented on the website by two villages from the region of Čirpan, Kolju Marinovo (KM), Markovo (M); and one from the region of Stara Zagora, Iskrica (Is). The sub-Balkan dialect group is defined by a complex of features, some of which are shared with Rupic dialects and some of which are specific to the sub-Balkan group. The features illustrated below are characteristic of the sub-Balkan group, dialect, though one of its most salient features (the stressed ending /-a/ in 1st singular present tense forms) is found in only one of the villages represented here.
            The list below summarizes the most important features of the sub-Balkan dialect. It is based on the speech of these three villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.

Phonology
• The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”, namely /a/ in position before hard syllables and /e/ in position before soft syllables.
            Examples: čàkəj (KM4: 66), čàsə (KM5: 30) // jègne (KM5: 2)
• In most sub-Balkan dialects, the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” appears as /a/ in word-final position and /ɤ/ elsewhere (except in definite forms of feminine nouns in a consonant, where it is always stressed /ɤ/). In texts on this site, this general feature, /a/ in word-final position, occurs only in Iskrica; it is absent Koljo Marinovo and Markovo.      
            Examples from Iskrica: sɤ̀butə (Is1: 49), idɤ̀t (Is1: 36), mumɤ̀tə (Is1: 24), vičirtɤ̀ (Is3: 61) // ležà (Is1: 4), nəsəd’à (Is2: 21) rəkà (Is2: 16) // kɤ̀štə (M4: 40), vudɤ̀ (KM5: 43), kačɤ̀ (KM4: 75).        
• There is full vowel reduction: all unstressed non-high vowels are replaced by the corresponding high vowels. Thus, unstressed /e/, /o/, and /a/ are replaced by /i/, /u/, and /ə/, respectively.
            Examples: vr’èmi (M: 5), pičèm (KM1: 15), pribìrəmi (KM1: 8), ditè (Is1: 15) // d’àdu (M: 7), vulòvi (KM1: 73), pus’ègnə (Is1: 3) // kvəsnìk (KM1: 17), nəsəd’à (Is2: 21).
• Before or after sonorants, /e/ and /i/ are replaced by /’ə/, almost exclusively in post-tonic syllables.
            Examples: mèn’ə (M: 37), vèč’ər (Is1: 75), vr’ətènu (Is1: 69) // užèn’əh (Is1: 1), kùp’əl (M: 10).
• Unstressed /e/ and /i/ are replaced by /u/ after post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: čušmɤ̀ (KM5: 40), žulezà (KM4: 6), žuv’èjət (M: 145)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ before labial consonants in stressed syllables; this occurs only in Iskrica.
            Example: ot’ùvəme (Is1: 71)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: bəkɤ̀rti (KM6: 43), fcèti (M: 40), grədìntə (M: 27), jergènti (M: 89), bàncətə (Is1: 2), sèltu (Is1: 27)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial /e/.
            Examples: jèsenno (KM6: 3), jergènti (M: 89),  jeno-(Is2: 1)
• The consonant /x/ behaves differently depending on its place in the word. In initial position or between vowels, it is lost altogether, in all three villages. In medial position before a consonant it is replaced by /j/ in Markovo and Kolju Marinovo, but lost in Iskrica (frequently with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel). In final position it is either preserved or replaced by /h/  in Koljo Marinovo and Markovo, but replaced by /h/ or /w/ in Iskrica .
            Examples of initial position: òdili (KM3: 35), l’àb (Is3: 25)
            Examples of medial position: dokàrvəə (KM3: 70), ràdvəə (Is1: 9) // isɤ̀jnaa (KM5: 11), ìməjmi (KM5: 42) // zè:me (Is2: 26), prɤ̀ska:mi (Is2: 15), b’àme (Is1: 16)
            Examples of final position:  zər’àzəx (KM5: 11), nəpràvih (M: 39), t’ah (M: 174) // zəbràiw (Is1: 50), zəvɤ̀ršiw (Is3: 16)
• The consonants /l/ and /n/ are softened before soft and post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: gədùl’ki (KM6: 28), mənìn’ki (KM6: 57), mɤl’čɤ̀t (M: 192), nəžil’t’àvə (Is2: 35), t’àn’te (Is2: 3)
• The sequences /dn/ and sometimes also /tn/, and /bn/ are assimilated to /nn/ and /mn/, respectively.
            Examples: plànne (KM5: 44), pannà (M:37), ennà (Is1: 68); s’ènne (I1: 13) // srɤ̀mnəl (M: 130)
• Fricative consonants are replaced by affricates after /r/.
            Examples: vɤ̀rdzənə (KM6: 8), dərdžàə (M:50), dərdžàl (KM5: 30), svɤ̀rdzənu (Is1: 63)
 
Accent
• There is occasional occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: šìlencàtə (KM3: 1), zɤ̀pčetàtə (KM4: 77), àgneàta (Is3: 8)
• The accent is retracted in the plural of feminine nouns, and sometimes also in the singular.
            Examples: dɤ̀ski (KM3: 64), sèstri (M: 72) // rɤ̀kə (KM6: 31) // dəskɤ̀tə (KM3: 71)
• The accent sometimes advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles.
            Examples: stanà (KM5: 9), pannà (M: 37), ustanà (M: 129), kəzàl (M: 17), ustanàli (M: 13), stənà: (Is1: 21)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for polysyllabic masculine nouns is /-e/, though /i/ appears as well.
            Examples: kəràre (KM3: 25), ərmàne (KM2: 70); čekɤ̀mi (KM2: 61), krèmeni (KM3: 57)
• The ending of feminine nouns when stress is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely/ɤ/, except in the non-definite form in Iskrica.
            Examples: rikɤ̀tə (KM5: 63), vujnɤ̀tɤ̥ (M: 13), mumɤ̀tə (Is1: 24) // veselbà (Is1: 63)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. It was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns.
• There are different forms of the personal pronouns, including differences between the three villages. Examples:
            3rd singular accusative feminine short form: gə in Markovo and Iskrica // jə in Koljo Marinovo
           Examples: žə jə nəmùšiš (KM2: 16), up’èkələ gə (Is1: 2) // nìj gə pràimi (M: 4) 
            3rd plural nominative: tìj (KM4: 8, M: 10), tìjə (KM3: 43), t’èe (Is1: 9)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dàdəh (M: 36), prudàdəjmi (M: 40), dòjdah (Is1: 1)
• The future particle is že.
            Examples: že izl’èzim (M: 89), že tùriš (KM2: 9),  že dòət (Is3: 42)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111), up’èkələ (Is1: 2)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
The dialect of Iskrica, which is very close to the Rupic area, has some additional features considered predominantly Rupic:
• Under stress he historical Slavic vowel “jat” frequently appears as /’a/ or /ɛ/ before a soft consonant or front vowel.
            Examples: t’àn’te (Is2: 29), n’àštu (Is3: 17), gul’ɛ̀mi (Is 2: 1) // b’èše (Is1: 1)
• The nominative pronoun for 1st person singular is /ja/.
            Example: jà sɤzdàdəw (Is1: 17)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
            Examples: nər’àdəme  (Is2: 40), zəfàt’ət  (Is1: 59)

"Golica","3","Varna","NORTHEASTERN: EASTERN BALKAN: Erkeč
            This very archaic dialect was originally spoken only in two villages located in the easternmost edge of the Balkan mountain range, near the Black Sea. These two villages, Kozičino and Golica, are situated on opposite sides of the mountain range, with each of them belonging to a different administrative district (Golica in the Dolni Čiflik district of Varna region, and Kozičino in the Pomorie district of Burgas region). The name of the dialect group (Erkeč) is in fact the old name of the village of Kozičino.
            The geographical scope of the dialect expanded considerably in the 19th century, when original inhabitants of these two villages spread out to regions of Pomorie, Varna, Balčik and Dobrič, either to establish new settlements or to join existing ones. Of these, villages which retained (or adopted) the Erkeč dialect are readily recognizable by their speech (primarily in the occurrence of the broad vowel /ɛ/ in words that contained the historical Slavic vowel “back jer”).
            The Erkeč dialect is usually grouped together with Balkan dialects; Bojadžiev calls it (together with the sub-Balkan group) “Eastern Balkan” (Bojadžiev 1981). But it is connected by at least one important feature – the behavior of the historical Slavic vowel “jat” – also to Moesian dialects (located further to the north) and Eastern Rupic dialects (located further to the south). At the same time, the Erkeč dialect is known for its unique (and in the view of some, “exotic”) sound, resulting from the vowels /ɛ/ and /ɑ/, and from the lengthened pronunciation of stressed open vowels.
            This dialect is represented on the website by the two original villages, Kozičino (K), and Golica (G), and also by the village Izgrev (I). The list below summarizes the salient features of the Erkeč dialect. It is based on the speech of these three villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kozičino 1, G2 = Golica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Izgrev: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Izgrev described here is located in the Varna region; on the website it is labeled Izgrev/Var.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ before hard syllable and as /’ɛ/ before soft syllables (that is, as in the standard language except for the fact of the open /ɛ/ preceded by softness); in word-final position it appears as /’a/.
            Examples: l’àp (K1: 51), pl’àvətə (I2: 5), dv’à (G5: 22) // s’ɛ̀li (G3: 175), b’ɛ̀hme (K1: 125), izlɛ̀ze (I2: 14).
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”.
            Examples: čàsa (G5: 16), venčàwət (G3: 70) //  təč’ɛ̀hme (K1: 30), š’ɛ̀jək (K1: 152), dəmədž’ɛ̀ni (I1: 5), təpəwdž’ɛ̀ri K1: 91)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer”, “back nasal”, and in some instances “front jer” merged in stressed syllables, all developing into /ɛ/.
            Examples of back jer: dɛ̀š (G3: 80), vəzgɛ̀nəhə (G3: 157), bɛ̀cvitȅ (I1: 9)
            Examples of back nasal: mɛ̀š:tȅ (K1: 152), pɛ̀t’ə (G3: 164), mɛ̀či (I1: 12)
            Examples of front jer: pɛ̀stər (G5: 41), zɛ̀mnət (G1: 9); l’èsnu (K1: 36)
   This is basically the same broad vowel found in Teteven (Western Balkan), except that in the Erkeč dialect it is pronounced more broadly, and occurs much more frequently.
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (i.e. absence of the phenomenon “merger of nasals”).
            Examples: z’èt’e (G5: 62), žètva (G3: 32)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as in the standard language, but with the vowel /ɛ/ instead of /ɤ/.
            Examples: dɛ̀rti (G1: 2), krɛ̀st’at (G3: 51), trɛ̀gnəli (G5: 86); pɛ̀l’nim (I1: 6), bɛ̀l’hitȅ (G3: 174)
• In stressed syllables, the vowel /a/ is retracted to /ɑ/, a change presumably due to the very low pronunciation of the front vowel /ɛ/: when the latter was pronounced so close to /a/ as to invade its “auditory space”, the distinction between the two was preserved by the retraction of /a/ to /ɑ/.
            Examples: decɑ̀ (G2: 15), sirɑ̀k (G6: 27)
• In stressed syllables, the vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ or /y/ after a post-alveolar consonant; this happens more frequently if the following consonant is labial.
            Examples: kumšùja (G2: 18), žuv’ɛ̀jət (G1: 3), žỳvu (G5: 5)
     In verbal endings for past tenses these changes can occur after other consonants.
            Example: hòd’uw (G3: 130)
• An initial stressed /o/ is frequently replaced by /wo/.
            Examples: wògən’ə (K1: 92), wòs’əm (G2: 15)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: vujnìstȅ (G5: 76), bùctȅ (K1: 110)
• When an unstressed vowel is lost after a continuant, the latter is lengthened, especially if it is a sonorant; this is the process termed “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: harmɑ̀n:tȅ (G3: 42), č’ètir:tȅ (G5: 8), č’èl:tu (K1: 98), mɛ̀š:tȅ (K1: 152)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions.
            Examples: hùrka (G3: 22), hrənɛ̀tə (K1: 53), prid’àh (G3: 8)
• The consonant /f/ is regularly replaced by /h/.
            Examples: kərtòhenə (G5: 85), sòhia (G5: 53), čùht (k1: 8)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: d’èset’ (G2: 16), dèn’ (I2: 9), wrahɑ̀n’ (K1: 39)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: kòl’č’eto (G5: 31), dɛ̀l’g’i (K1: 155)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: glɑ̀nni (G5: 74), ennì (k1: 3), gùnna (g4: 12)
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /vn/.
            Examples: zapòvn’uw (G3: 83), utɛ̀vnət (G5: 69)
• The consonant /v/ is preserved only before front vowels. It is replaced by /w/ before non-front unrounded vowels and sonorants, and is lost before rounded vowels.
            Examples: vìdel (G5: 75), vèšti (K5: 50), trevɛ̀tə (G5: 54) // wàdi (K1: 108), wlɑ̀čim (K2: 2), wrɑ̀čkə (G5: 8) // kəkò (G2: 24), udɛ̀tə (G3: 139)
• The consonant /j/ is replaced by /v/ after rounded vowels.
            Example: stuv’à (G5: 3)
 
Accent
• The accent fails to shift in the plural form of some monosyllabic masculine nouns.
            Examples: wòlovi (G3: 88), mɛ̀žitȅ (K1: 143)
• In disyllabic feminine nouns, the accent is retracted in the plural only.
            Examples: ženɑ̀ (G5: 36); svìni (G6: 37), òfci (I1: 23), bɛ̀l’hitȅ (G3: 174), žèn:tȅ (G3: 144)
•  There is frequent occurrence of secondary stress on the plural article of nouns, and sometimes on the feminine and neuter singular article.
            Examples: harmɑ̀n:tȅ (G3: 42), vujnìstȅ (G5: 76), kòzintȁ (K2: 116), č’èl:tȕ (K1: 98)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunctions “kato” and “ako”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kət nì zəkàrəhə (G5: 37), kət sɛ̀ uprust’ì (K2: 11), kət sɛ̀ rəst’ɛ̀li (G3: 104) // [no examples of “ako” in texts on the website]
 
Morphology
• Although the normal plural ending for polysyllabic masculine nouns is /-i/, there are several instances of the ending /-e/, all of them in Golica.
            Examples: pisɑ̀ri (G3: 66), kurbàni (G3: 143), təpəwdž’ɛ̀ri (K1: 91) // šmàjzere (G5: 38), kamiòne (G5: 26)
• The definite article /-to/ appears in masculine plural nouns, though rarely.
            Example: komunìstetu (G5: 24)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɛ/. Nouns denoting humans, however, have the ending /-a/.
            Examples: rəkɛ̀ (I1: 8), trevɛ̀tə (G5: 54) // ženɑ̀ (G5: 36)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.
• Indefinite adjectives appear in the long form.
            Example: drùgij (G3: 82)
• The 3rd singular object pronoun is used in place of the demonstrative pronominal adjective.
            Examples: n’ègo dèn (G5: 25), n’ègu plàt (K1: 143), nèja godìna (G3: 96)
• Тhe complementizer ‘da’ is frequently dropped from the negative future.
            Examples: n’èmə stìgət (K1: 22), n’èmə ìmə (K1: 26) // n’èmə də ustàne (G4: 6)
• The imperfectivizing suffix /-ga-/ is found in some verbs.
            Examples: iznəm’àrgəme (K1: 15), zəpàlgə (G5: 102)

• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: vujnìstȅ (G5: 76), bùctȅ (K1: 110)
• When an unstressed vowel is lost after a continuant, the latter is lengthened, especially if it is a sonorant; this is the process termed “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: harmɑ̀n:tȅ (G3: 42), č’ètir:tȅ (G5: 8), č’èl:tu (K1: 98), mɛ̀š:tȅ (K1: 152)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions.
            Examples: hùrka (G3: 22), hrənɛ̀tə (K1: 53), prid’àh (G3: 8)
• The consonant /f/ is regularly replaced by /h/.
            Examples: kərtòhenə (G5: 85), sòhia (G5: 53), čùht (k1: 8)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: d’èset’ (G2: 16), dèn’ (I2: 9), wrahɑ̀n’ (K1: 39)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: kòl’č’eto (G5: 31), dɛ̀l’g’i (K1: 155)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: glɑ̀nni (G5: 74), ennì (k1: 3), gùnna (g4: 12)
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /vn/.
            Examples: zapòvn’uw (G3: 83), utɛ̀vnət (G5: 69)
• The consonant /v/ is preserved only before front vowels. It is replaced by /w/ before non-front unrounded vowels and sonorants, and is lost before rounded vowels.
            Examples: vìdel (G5: 75), vèšti (K5: 50), trevɛ̀tə (G5: 54) // wàdi (K1: 108), wlɑ̀čim (K2: 2), wrɑ̀čkə (G5: 8) // kəkò (G2: 24), udɛ̀tə (G3: 139)
• The consonant /j/ is replaced by /v/ after rounded vowels.
            Example: stuv’à (G5: 3)
 
Accent
• The accent fails to shift in the plural form of some monosyllabic masculine nouns.
            Examples: wòlovi (G3: 88), mɛ̀žitȅ (K1: 143)
• In disyllabic feminine nouns, the accent is retracted in the plural only.
            Examples: ženɑ̀ (G5: 36); svìni (G6: 37), òfci (I1: 23), bɛ̀l’hitȅ (G3: 174), žèn:tȅ (G3: 144)
•  There is frequent occurrence of secondary stress on the plural article of nouns, and sometimes on the feminine and neuter singular article.
            Examples: harmɑ̀n:tȅ (G3: 42), vujnìstȅ (G5: 76), kòzintȁ (K2: 116), č’èl:tȕ (K1: 98)
• Clitic forms (short form object pronouns, reflexive particles, and present tense forms of the verb “sŭm”) are stressed after the conjunctions “kato” and “ako”; this phenomenon is termed “additional accent”
            Examples: kət nì zəkàrəhə (G5: 37), kət sɛ̀ uprust’ì (K2: 11), kət sɛ̀ rəst’ɛ̀li (G3: 104) // [no examples of “ako” in texts on the website]
 
Morphology
• Although the normal plural ending for polysyllabic masculine nouns is /-i/, there are several instances of the ending /-e/, all of them in Golica.
            Examples: pisɑ̀ri (G3: 66), kurbàni (G3: 143), təpəwdž’ɛ̀ri (K1: 91) // šmàjzere (G5: 38), kamiòne (G5: 26)
• The definite article /-to/ appears in masculine plural nouns, though rarely.
            Example: komunìstetu (G5: 24)
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɛ/. Nouns denoting humans, however, have the ending /-a/.
            Examples: rəkɛ̀ (I1: 8), trevɛ̀tə (G5: 54) // ženɑ̀ (G5: 36)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, the old nominative form in /-a/ was adopted as the single form for feminine nouns meaning persons, and the casus generalis was adopted as the single form for all other feminine nouns.
• Indefinite adjectives appear in the long form.
            Example: drùgij (G3: 82)
• The 3rd singular object pronoun is used in place of the demonstrative pronominal adjective.
            Examples: n’ègo dèn (G5: 25), n’ègu plàt (K1: 143), nèja godìna (G3: 96)
• Тhe complementizer ‘da’ is frequently dropped from the negative future.
            Examples: n’èmə stìgət (K1: 22), n’èmə ìmə (K1: 26) // n’èmə də ustàne (G4: 6)
• The imperfectivizing suffix /-ga-/ is found in some verbs.
            Examples: iznəm’àrgəme (K1: 15), zəpàlgə (G5: 102)

"Izgrev/Var","5","Varna","NORTHEASTERN: EASTERN BALKAN: Erkeč
            This very archaic dialect was originally spoken only in two villages located in the easternmost edge of the Balkan mountain range, near the Black Sea. These two villages, Kozičino and Golica, are situated on opposite sides of the mountain range, with each of them belonging to a different administrative district (Golica in the Dolni Čiflik district of Varna region, and Kozičino in the Pomorie district of Burgas region). The name of the dialect group (Erkeč) is in fact the old name of the village of Kozičino.
            The geographical scope of the dialect expanded considerably in the 19th century, when original inhabitants of these two villages spread out to regions of Pomorie, Varna, Balčik and Dobrič, either to establish new settlements or to join existing ones. Of these, villages which retained (or adopted) the Erkeč dialect are readily recognizable by their speech (primarily in the occurrence of the broad vowel /ɛ/ in words that contained the historical Slavic vowel “back jer”).
            The Erkeč dialect is usually grouped together with Balkan dialects; Bojadžiev calls it (together with the sub-Balkan group) “Eastern Balkan” (Bojadžiev 1981). But it is connected by at least one important feature – the behavior of the historical Slavic vowel “jat” – also to Moesian dialects (located further to the north) and Eastern Rupic dialects (located further to the south). At the same time, the Erkeč dialect is known for its unique (and in the view of some, “exotic”) sound, resulting from the vowels /ɛ/ and /ɑ/, and from the lengthened pronunciation of stressed open vowels.
            This dialect is represented on the website by the two original villages, Kozičino (K), and Golica (G), and also by the village Izgrev (I). The list below summarizes the salient features of the Erkeč dialect. It is based on the speech of these three villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. K1 = Kozičino 1, G2 = Golica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. Note that the website includes two different villages bearing the name Izgrev: they are further identified on the website by abbreviations referring to the administrative region in which they are located. The Izgrev described here is located in the Varna region; on the website it is labeled Izgrev/Var.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ before hard syllable and as /’ɛ/ before soft syllables (that is, as in the standard language except for the fact of the open /ɛ/ preceded by softness); in word-final position it appears as /’a/.
            Examples: l’àp (K1: 51), pl’àvətə (I2: 5), dv’à (G5: 22) // s’ɛ̀li (G3: 175), b’ɛ̀hme (K1: 125), izlɛ̀ze (I2: 14).
• The results of the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same as those of “jat”.
            Examples: čàsa (G5: 16), venčàwət (G3: 70) //  təč’ɛ̀hme (K1: 30), š’ɛ̀jək (K1: 152), dəmədž’ɛ̀ni (I1: 5), təpəwdž’ɛ̀ri K1: 91)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer”, “back nasal”, and in some instances “front jer” merged in stressed syllables, all developing into /ɛ/.
            Examples of back jer: dɛ̀š (G3: 80), vəzgɛ̀nəhə (G3: 157), bɛ̀cvitȅ (I1: 9)
            Examples of back nasal: mɛ̀š:tȅ (K1: 152), pɛ̀t’ə (G3: 164), mɛ̀či (I1: 12)
            Examples of front jer: pɛ̀stər (G5: 41), zɛ̀mnət (G1: 9); l’èsnu (K1: 36)
   This is basically the same broad vowel found in Teteven (Western Balkan), except that in the Erkeč dialect it is pronounced more broadly, and occurs much more frequently.
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (i.e. absence of the phenomenon “merger of nasals”).
            Examples: z’èt’e (G5: 62), žètva (G3: 32)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids appear as in the standard language, but with the vowel /ɛ/ instead of /ɤ/.
            Examples: dɛ̀rti (G1: 2), krɛ̀st’at (G3: 51), trɛ̀gnəli (G5: 86); pɛ̀l’nim (I1: 6), bɛ̀l’hitȅ (G3: 174)
• In stressed syllables, the vowel /a/ is retracted to /ɑ/, a change presumably due to the very low pronunciation of the front vowel /ɛ/: when the latter was pronounced so close to /a/ as to invade its “auditory space”, the distinction between the two was preserved by the retraction of /a/ to /ɑ/.
            Examples: decɑ̀ (G2: 15), sirɑ̀k (G6: 27)
• In stressed syllables, the vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ or /y/ after a post-alveolar consonant; this happens more frequently if the following consonant is labial.
            Examples: kumšùja (G2: 18), žuv’ɛ̀jət (G1: 3), žỳvu (G5: 5)
     In verbal endings for past tenses these changes can occur after other consonants.
            Example: hòd’uw (G3: 130)
• An initial stressed /o/ is frequently replaced by /wo/.
            Examples: wògən’ə (K1: 92), wòs’əm (G2: 15)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: vujnìstȅ (G5: 76), bùctȅ (K1: 110)
• When an unstressed vowel is lost after a continuant, the latter is lengthened, especially if it is a sonorant; this is the process termed “consonant-vowel fusion”.
            Examples: harmɑ̀n:tȅ (G3: 42), č’ètir:tȅ (G5: 8), č’èl:tu (K1: 98), mɛ̀š:tȅ (K1: 152)
• The consonant /x/ is replaced by /h/ in all positions.
            Examples: hùrka (G3: 22), hrənɛ̀tə (K1: 53), prid’àh (G3: 8)
• The consonant /f/ is regularly replaced by /h/.
            Examples: kərtòhenə (G5: 85), sòhia (G5: 53), čùht (k1: 8)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: d’èset’ (G2: 16), dèn’ (I2: 9), wrahɑ̀n’ (K1: 39)
• The consonant /l/ is palatalized before soft consonants.
            Examples: kòl’č’eto (G5: 31), dɛ̀l’g’i (K1: 155)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: glɑ̀nni (G5: 74), ennì (k1: 3), gùnna (g4: 12)
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /vn/.
            Examples: zapòvn’uw (G3: 83), utɛ̀vnət (G5: 69)
• The consonant /v/ is preserved only before front vowels. It is replaced by /w/ before non-front unrounded vowels and sonorants, and is lost before rounded vowels.
            Examples: vìdel (G5: 75), vèšti (K5: 50), trevɛ̀tə (G5: 54) // wàdi (K1: 108), wlɑ̀čim (K2: 2), wrɑ̀čkə (G5: 8) // kəkò (G2: 24), udɛ̀tə (G3: 139)
• The consonant /j/ is replaced by /v/ after rounded vowels.
            Example: stuv’à (G5: 3)
 
Accent
• The accent fails to shift in the plural form of some monosyllabic masculine nouns.
            Examples: wòlovi (G3: 88), mɛ̀žitȅ (K1: 143)
• In disyllabic feminine nouns, the accent is retracted in the plural only.
            Examples: ženɑ̀ (G5: 36); svìni (G6: 37), òfci (I1: 23), bɛ̀l’hitȅ (G3: 174), žèn:tȅ (G3: 144)
•  There is frequent occurrence of secondary stress on the plural article of nouns, and sometimes on the feminine and neuter singular article.

"Rakovski","6","Plovdiv","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Pavlikjani
            This is a special group of dialects, which takes its name from the ethnic-religious identity of its speakers: the Pavlikjani (Paulicians) are Bulgarian Catholics. Their dialect was grouped among the Rhodope dialect by Miletič (Miletič 1912) because it indeed displays significant Rhodope traits; yet at the same time, it also lacks a sizeable number of significant Rhodope traits. What is most interesting about the dialect is that the Bulgarian Catholics who speak it live in two regions quite distant from one another, separated by a major mountain range. The southern group, located near the city of Plovdiv, is here represented by the villages of Žitnica and Rakovski (formerly three villages with the same dialect). The northern group, located near the city of Svištov, is here represented by the village of Trŭnčovica. Yet despite this great geographical spread, the dialect is surprisingly uniform. Indeed, the major differences discussed below are not between the north and the south but rather between the two villages representing the southern part.
            The list below summarizes the salient features representing the Pavlikjani dialect. It is based on the speech of the three villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. T1 = Trŭnčovica 1, Ž2 = Žitnica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. The single letter R refers to the text from Rakovski (the informant is from the former village General Nikolaevo, one of the three that was merged into Rakovski).
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /e/  in Rakovski in and Žitnica, while in Trŭnčovica its reflex is the same as in the standard language.
            Examples: b’èlim  (R: 6), bèjə  (Ž2: 7) // d’àdu (T2: 27), smèe (T2: 24)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” appear in stressed syllables as /a/,  except after the consonant /č/,  where it appears as /e/.
            Examples: jàdene  (T1: 14), pijàvɨci  (T2: 88) // kuč’en’a  (R: 6), čèk  (R: 27), ufčèrete  (T2: 25)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/.
            Examples for back jer: zɤ̀lvi  (R: 39), dɤ̀š  (T2: 78), rɤ̀š  (Ž3: 15)
            Examples for back nasal: kɤ̀štə  (R: 43), pɤ̀t  (R: 42), mɤ̀či  (T2: 24), kɤ̀štə  (Ž3: 18)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/  in Rakovski, while in Trŭnčovica and Žitnica they appear as /e̝/.
            Examples for front jer: d’ɤ̀n  (R: 6) // dè̝n  (T1: 53), dnè̝s  (T2: 42), zè̝me  (Ž3: 10)
            Examples for front nasal: dev’ɤ̀tə  (R: 37), p’ɤ̀t  (R: 33) // pè̝t  (T1: 19), nəre̝ždət  (T1: 34), nərè̝d  (Ž3: 11)
     After post-alveolar consonants, however, both nasals appear everywhere as /ɤ/. This is the well-known “merger of the nasals”.
            Examples: ušɤ̀tə  (T1: 54), žɤ̀nnə  (Ž3: 11)
    The situation in Rakovski is thus like in other Rhodope dialects: the two jers  and two nasals merge except for the mark of consonant softening preceding the vowel continuing front jer and front nasal. This is a significant difference between the speech of Rakovski and that of the other two villages.
• There is a very interesting series of vowel shifts, some found in the speech of all three villages, and some only in Rakovski.
     First, the vowel /o/  is replaced by /u/  or /u:/  in stressed syllables in Rakovski.
            Examples: ùsem  (R: 26), ùrə  (R: 17); ù:rə  (R: 28), dù:r  (R: 43)
     Second, the vowel /e/  is raised to /e̝/  in stressed syllables in Trŭnčovica and Žitnica; in Rakovski it is raised even more, and is replaced by /i/.
            Examples: mè̝ne (T2: 53), jədè̝m (T2: 56), səberè̝me  (Ž3: 2), murè̝tu (Ž3: 21) // berìm   (R: 5), sìlu   (R3)
     Finally, the vowel /i/  is retracted to /ɨ/  in all three villages.
            Examples: nɨ̀tɨte  (Ž3: 5), kɨlɨ̀mče̥tə  (T1: 22), rəzbɨ̀rəjme  (R: 41)
    Some scholars, on seeing the latter vowel, have claimed that the historical Slavic vowel “jery”  has been maintained here, just as in the Tihomir dialect. But this is disproven by the lexical distribution: all instances of /i/  (both those derived from original /i/  and original “jery”) are retracted to /ɨ/.
     What has happened instead is an instance of what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift. Here, vowels of the middle level (/o/  and /e/)  are raised to a higher level – in the case of Rakovski all the the way to /i/. But the distinction between underlying /e/  and underlying /i/  is not lost, since the latter now shifts to its retracted variant /ɨ/.
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: čètrɨ  (R: 41), d’àt  (T2: 94), tvàrə  (Ž1: 7)
• The consonant /x/  is lost in most positions. In verbal endings it may be replaced by /j/.   Examples: ərìsət  (R: 30), rànəd  (T1: 42), òdə  (Ž2: 1), bème  (R: 2) // bèj  (R: 2), zəvɤ̀ršij  (R: 1), skàrvəjme  (Ž1: 9), uràj  (T2: 40)
• The consonant /v/  is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dù:r  (R: 43), kò  (Ž3: 7), uòškə  (T1: 8)
• The sequence /dn/  is assimitaled to /nn/.
            Examples: žɤ̀nnə  (Ž3: 11), glànnɨ  (Ž3: 1)
• After labial consonants, /n’/  is inserted.
            Example: bàmn’a  (Ž2: 2)
 
Accent
• The accent advances to the final syllable in the definite form of some masculine singular nouns.
            Examples: deverɤ̀t  (R: 39), svekərɤ̀t  (R: 44)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: kusɤ̀tə  (T2: 90), zem’ɤ̀tə  (Ž3: 21)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.

"Trŭnčovica","7","Nikopol","CENTRAL RUPIC: RHODOPE: Pavlikjani
            This is a special group of dialects, which takes its name from the ethnic-religious identity of its speakers: the Pavlikjani (Paulicians) are Bulgarian Catholics. Their dialect was grouped among the Rhodope dialect by Miletič (Miletič 1912) because it indeed displays significant Rhodope traits; yet at the same time, it also lacks a sizeable number of significant Rhodope traits. What is most interesting about the dialect is that the Bulgarian Catholics who speak it live in two regions quite distant from one another, separated by a major mountain range. The southern group, located near the city of Plovdiv, is here represented by the villages of Žitnica and Rakovski (formerly three villages with the same dialect). The northern group, located near the city of Svištov, is here represented by the village of Trŭnčovica. Yet despite this great geographical spread, the dialect is surprisingly uniform. Indeed, the major differences discussed below are not between the north and the south but rather between the two villages representing the southern part.
            The list below summarizes the salient features representing the Pavlikjani dialect. It is based on the speech of the three villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. T1 = Trŭnčovica 1, Ž2 = Žitnica 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs. The single letter R refers to the text from Rakovski (the informant is from the former village General Nikolaevo, one of the three that was merged into Rakovski).
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /e/  in Rakovski in and Žitnica, while in Trŭnčovica its reflex is the same as in the standard language.
            Examples: b’èlim  (R: 6), bèjə  (Ž2: 7) // d’àdu (T2: 27), smèe (T2: 24)
• The historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” appear in stressed syllables as /a/,  except after the consonant /č/,  where it appears as /e/.
            Examples: jàdene  (T1: 14), pijàvɨci  (T2: 88) // kuč’en’a  (R: 6), čèk  (R: 27), ufčèrete  (T2: 25)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /ɤ/.
            Examples for back jer: zɤ̀lvi  (R: 39), dɤ̀š  (T2: 78), rɤ̀š  (Ž3: 15)
            Examples for back nasal: kɤ̀štə  (R: 43), pɤ̀t  (R: 42), mɤ̀či  (T2: 24), kɤ̀štə  (Ž3: 18)
• The historical Slavic vowels “front jer” and “front nasal” appear in stressed syllables as /’ɤ/  in Rakovski, while in Trŭnčovica and Žitnica they appear as /e̝/.
            Examples for front jer: d’ɤ̀n  (R: 6) // dè̝n  (T1: 53), dnè̝s  (T2: 42), zè̝me  (Ž3: 10)
            Examples for front nasal: dev’ɤ̀tə  (R: 37), p’ɤ̀t  (R: 33) // pè̝t  (T1: 19), nəre̝ždət  (T1: 34), nərè̝d  (Ž3: 11)
     After post-alveolar consonants, however, both nasals appear everywhere as /ɤ/. This is the well-known “merger of the nasals”.
            Examples: ušɤ̀tə  (T1: 54), žɤ̀nnə  (Ž3: 11)
    The situation in Rakovski is thus like in other Rhodope dialects: the two jers  and two nasals merge except for the mark of consonant softening preceding the vowel continuing front jer and front nasal. This is a significant difference between the speech of Rakovski and that of the other two villages.
• There is a very interesting series of vowel shifts, some found in the speech of all three villages, and some only in Rakovski.
     First, the vowel /o/  is replaced by /u/  or /u:/  in stressed syllables in Rakovski.
            Examples: ùsem  (R: 26), ùrə  (R: 17); ù:rə  (R: 28), dù:r  (R: 43)
     Second, the vowel /e/  is raised to /e̝/  in stressed syllables in Trŭnčovica and Žitnica; in Rakovski it is raised even more, and is replaced by /i/.
            Examples: mè̝ne (T2: 53), jədè̝m (T2: 56), səberè̝me  (Ž3: 2), murè̝tu (Ž3: 21) // berìm   (R: 5), sìlu   (R3)
     Finally, the vowel /i/  is retracted to /ɨ/  in all three villages.
            Examples: nɨ̀tɨte  (Ž3: 5), kɨlɨ̀mče̥tə  (T1: 22), rəzbɨ̀rəjme  (R: 41)
    Some scholars, on seeing the latter vowel, have claimed that the historical Slavic vowel “jery”  has been maintained here, just as in the Tihomir dialect. But this is disproven by the lexical distribution: all instances of /i/  (both those derived from original /i/  and original “jery”) are retracted to /ɨ/.
     What has happened instead is an instance of what linguists call a “chain shift”, in which distinctions between vowels are maintained even as the individual vowels shift. Here, vowels of the middle level (/o/  and /e/)  are raised to a higher level – in the case of Rakovski all the the way to /i/. But the distinction between underlying /e/  and underlying /i/  is not lost, since the latter now shifts to its retracted variant /ɨ/.
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: čètrɨ  (R: 41), d’àt  (T2: 94), tvàrə  (Ž1: 7)
• The consonant /x/  is lost in most positions. In verbal endings it may be replaced by /j/.   Examples: ərìsət  (R: 30), rànəd  (T1: 42), òdə  (Ž2: 1), bème  (R: 2) // bèj  (R: 2), zəvɤ̀ršij  (R: 1), skàrvəjme  (Ž1: 9), uràj  (T2: 40)
• The consonant /v/  is lost before a rounded vowel.
            Examples: dù:r  (R: 43), kò  (Ž3: 7), uòškə  (T1: 8)
• The sequence /dn/  is assimitaled to /nn/.
            Examples: žɤ̀nnə  (Ž3: 11), glànnɨ  (Ž3: 1)
• After labial consonants, /n’/  is inserted.
            Example: bàmn’a  (Ž2: 2)
 
Accent
• The accent advances to the final syllable in the definite form of some masculine singular nouns.
            Examples: deverɤ̀t  (R: 39), svekərɤ̀t  (R: 44)
 
Morphology
• The ending of feminine nouns, when stressed, is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/.
            Examples: kusɤ̀tə  (T2: 90), zem’ɤ̀tə  (Ž3: 21)
     These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In these dialects, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns (which elsewhere have adopted the old nominative case in /a/  as their single form.  
      The other two traits are specific to the northern and southern groups, respectively.
• In Trŭnčovica only, the plural ending for masculine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ufčèrete  (T2: 25), bɨ̀ulete  (T2: 67) // kilugràmɨ (R: 23), dè̝kərɨ (Ž2: 6)
• In Rakovski and Žitnica the definite article for masculine singular nouns is /-ɤt/ (when unstressed, /-ət/  or /-ɤt/), while in Trŭnčovica the final /-t/  is missing.
            Examples: deverɤ̀t  (R: 39), dvòrət  (Ž1: 8), kɤ̀rɤt  (Ž2: 8) // gərbɤ̀  (T1: 21), umɤ̀  (T2: 18)

"Stakevci","9","Belogradčik","TRANSITIONAL: Belogradčik
            The dialect of Belogradčik is located in the far northwest near the border with Serbia and is represented on the website by the villages Repljana (R), Stakevci (S), and Vŭrbovo (V). Together with the Trŭn dialect, it is part of larger group of dialects which share traits with the neighboring far eastern Serbian dialects. For this reason, the dialects in the larger group are sometimes called “transitional dialects” or “border dialects”. They are also known as “u-dialects” or “č-dž” dialects, with each of these names referring to major dialect traits shared with these neighboring Serbian dialects.
            Whichever name is used for this larger dialect group, it is striking that there is so little internal variation, especially given the fact that speakers in this northern portion of the area (the Belogradčik dialect group, represented here by Repljana, Stakevci and Vŭrbovo) and the speakers in the southern portion (called the Trŭn dialect group and represented on this site by the village of Nasalevci) are rarely in contact with one another due to both to considerable physical distance and the fact of a mountain range separating them. Because the differences that do exist are noteworthy, the two groups are here described separately.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Belogradčik dialect group. It is based on the speech of the three villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. All three villages display the same traits, with the exception of the form of 3rd plural endings in the present tense (see the last point below for details).
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. R1 = Repljana 1, R2 = Repljana 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology.
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: valèlo (R1: 67), lèp (R1: 87)
• The historical sequence “ja”  (including the sequence “post-alveolar + a”) is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples:  jàgn’e (R 2: 7), običàli (R2: 87) // čèkaj (R2: 100), jèdene (R1: 88)
• The historical Slavic “back nasal” always appears as /u/.
            Examples: pùt (R1: 20), bùdu (R3: 2)
• The historical Slavic “front nasal” always appears as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants. Thus, the historical phenomenon known as “mixing of the nasals” does not occur here.
            Example: često (V3: 1)
• The historical Slavic “back jer” appears as /ɤ/, as in many other Bulgarian dialects. It is only in the “transitional” dialects, however, that the historical Slavic “front jer” also appears always as /ɤ/.
            Examples: dɤ̀n (R1: 29), venɤ̀cɤt (R4: 40)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged.
            Examples: kṛ̀v (R1: 23), skḷ̀če (R1: 42), vḷ̀nu (R3: 4)
• The Proto-Slavic sequences /*tj/ and /*dj/ appear as /č/ and /dž/, respectively.
            Examples: pràčam (R1: 43), razgledžuvà (S1: 49)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cṛ/.
            Example: cṛvèni (R2: 40)
• Early South Slavic “epenthetic /l/” is not lost, as it is in most other Bulgarian dialects.
            Example: zeml’ùtu (V1: 34)
• Soft consonants occur rarely, and never in masculine definite forms or in verbal endings (contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects).
            Examples: dɤ̀nɤt (R2: 13), bolù (R1: 103), opòvnu (V3: 23)
     In fact, only /k/, /g/, /l/, and /n/ have soft correlates at all.
• The consonant /x/ is lost everywhere, though it is replaced by /j/ when it occurs after /e/, and by /v/ when it occurs after /u/.
            Examples: rèko (R1: 18), zavanùla (S3: 51);  drèju (R3: 24), dùva (R3:30)
• The consonant /f / is always replaced by /v/.
            Example: vamìlija (R1: 11)
    In fact /f/ does not occur even as the voiceless allophone of /v/.
            Example: òvce (R1: 80)
• Intervocalic /j/ is replaced by /v/ after /o/.
            Example: stovà (S2: 16)
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ in word-initial position, and to /vn/ in other positions.
            Examples: mlògo (R1: 42), opòvnu (V3: 25)
• Before a vowel, the sequence /jk/ is replaced by /k’/.
            Example: devòk’u (V3: 13)
 
Accent
• The accent in monosyllabic masculine nouns hardly ever shifts to the definite article.
            Example: dɤ̀nɤt (R2: 13)
• The accent in the non-nominative form of disyllabic feminine nouns is shifted from the ending to the root syllable.
            Example: gòru (S1: 60)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in L-participles, regardless of whether there is a syllabic prefix or not.
            Examples: čuvàl (R1: 42), doodìli (R2: 26).
    The same advancement occurs in aorist forms, except that the accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 2nd and 3rd singular forms. Examples:
            1st singular aorist    ukačì (R1: 6)
            2nd singular aorist   pràti (S2: 21)
            3rd singular aorist   kìmnu (R1: 5), prèmi (R1: 49)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many second conjugation verbs.
            Example: svàri (R1: 83)
• The accent is frequently advanced to the ending in polysyllabic masculine nouns.
            Example: ovčarè (S4: 9)
• In some adjectives the stress is on the ending.
            Example: golemà (R1: 14)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for both masculine and feminine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ovčarè (S4: 9), livàdete (R1: 97)
• Plural forms of both adjectives and L-participles distinguish feminine from masculine gender.
            Examples: stàrete (R3: 14), vadìle (R3: 15)
 • Non-nominative forms of feminine nouns, feminine singular adjectives, and masculine nouns signifying animate beings, are in regular use.
            Examples: cṛ̀kvu (R2: 6), cèlu (S3: 28), volà (R1: 41)
        These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, such nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven): the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case (“animate accusative” in the  instance of the masculine nouns) and was used for all other meanings
• A particularly interesting corollary of the above is the fact that the definite article attached to these forms also shows inherited cases endings (/-tu/ for feminine and /-toga/ for animate masculine).  
            Example: livàdutu (R1: 4), kon’àtoga (V1: 45)
• The masculine singular definite article ends in the consonant /-t/.
            Example: vòlɤt (R1: 15)
• The forms of personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative  jà (R1: 4)
            3rd singular nominative   òn (R1: 5),  onà (R1: 16), onò (R2: 34)
            3rd singular feminine accusative short form  g’u (R2: 63)
            1st plural nominative  mì (R1: 20)
            3rd plural nominative onì (not attested in these texts)
            3rd plural accusative  n’ì  (R2: 19)
            3rd plural dative  n’ìm (R2: 19)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-ov-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Example: ovàj (R4: 6)
• The ending in all 1st person singular present tense forms is /-m/.
            Example: pasèm (R1: 4)
•  The ending in all 1st person plural tense forms (present, aorist and imperfect) is /-mo/.   Examples: ìdemo (R1: 20), oràmo (V2: 1) // manùmo (R2 116) // òdejmo (S4: 43)
• The 3rd plural ending of the present tense lacks the final /-t/ present in most other Bulgarian dialects. For more commentary on 3rd plural present forms, see the final section.
            Example: živèju (R1: 51)
• The 3rd plural ending of the aorist tense is /-še/; the ending /-u/ also appears in Vŭrbovo.
            Examples: razvalìše (R2: 8), izèdou (V2: 51)
• The suffix /-na/ is normally dropped from aorist and L-participle forms, though some verbs allow variation.
            Examples: sèdo (S1: 37), pàdla (R4: 13) // svikɤl (S2: 37), sviknùli (S2: 38)
• The stem of the imperfect forms contains the extender morpheme /-še-/.
            Example: ìmašemo (R1: 3)
• All passive participles are formed with the suffix /-n/.
            Example: svìena (R2: 30)
• Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example:  tùpan’e (R3: 21)
• The future particle is če, frequently followed by the conjunction da.
            Example: če da putùe (S1: 32)
 
NON-CONGRUENCE between dialects
    The only significant difference between the three villages represented here concerns the endings of the 3rd person plural present tense forms. In Repljana and Stakevci, second conjugation verbs take the ending /-e/, whereas in Vŭrbovo they take the ending /-u/.
            Examples:  ulòve (R1: 113), nadùpče (S4: 47) // sètu (V3: 28)
    In addition, there is a vowel contraction in the ending of third conjugation verbs in Repljana and Stakevci, but no such contraction in Vŭrbovo.
            Examples: iskàru (R1: 96), dùmu (S4: 18) // sàkaju (V3: 13)

"Repljana","10","Belogradčik","TRANSITIONAL: Belogradčik
            The dialect of Belogradčik is located in the far northwest near the border with Serbia and is represented on the website by the villages Repljana (R), Stakevci (S), and Vŭrbovo (V). Together with the Trŭn dialect, it is part of larger group of dialects which share traits with the neighboring far eastern Serbian dialects. For this reason, the dialects in the larger group are sometimes called “transitional dialects” or “border dialects”. They are also known as “u-dialects” or “č-dž” dialects, with each of these names referring to major dialect traits shared with these neighboring Serbian dialects.
            Whichever name is used for this larger dialect group, it is striking that there is so little internal variation, especially given the fact that speakers in this northern portion of the area (the Belogradčik dialect group, represented here by Repljana, Stakevci and Vŭrbovo) and the speakers in the southern portion (called the Trŭn dialect group and represented on this site by the village of Nasalevci) are rarely in contact with one another due to both to considerable physical distance and the fact of a mountain range separating them. Because the differences that do exist are noteworthy, the two groups are here described separately.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Belogradčik dialect group. It is based on the speech of the three villages represented on the site, with examples taken from the texts presented on this site. All three villages display the same traits, with the exception of the form of 3rd plural endings in the present tense (see the last point below for details).
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. R1 = Repljana 1, R2 = Repljana 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology.
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: valèlo (R1: 67), lèp (R1: 87)
• The historical sequence “ja”  (including the sequence “post-alveolar + a”) is preserved with very few exceptions.
            Examples:  jàgn’e (R 2: 7), običàli (R2: 87) // čèkaj (R2: 100), jèdene (R1: 88)
• The historical Slavic “back nasal” always appears as /u/.
            Examples: pùt (R1: 20), bùdu (R3: 2)
• The historical Slavic “front nasal” always appears as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants. Thus, the historical phenomenon known as “mixing of the nasals” does not occur here.
            Example: često (V3: 1)
• The historical Slavic “back jer” appears as /ɤ/, as in many other Bulgarian dialects. It is only in the “transitional” dialects, however, that the historical Slavic “front jer” also appears always as /ɤ/.
            Examples: dɤ̀n (R1: 29), venɤ̀cɤt (R4: 40)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged.
            Examples: kṛ̀v (R1: 23), skḷ̀če (R1: 42), vḷ̀nu (R3: 4)
• The Proto-Slavic sequences /*tj/ and /*dj/ appear as /č/ and /dž/, respectively.
            Examples: pràčam (R1: 43), razgledžuvà (S1: 49)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cṛ/.
            Example: cṛvèni (R2: 40)
• Early South Slavic “epenthetic /l/” is not lost, as it is in most other Bulgarian dialects.
            Example: zeml’ùtu (V1: 34)
• Soft consonants occur rarely, and never in masculine definite forms or in verbal endings (contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects).
            Examples: dɤ̀nɤt (R2: 13), bolù (R1: 103), opòvnu (V3: 23)
     In fact, only /k/, /g/, /l/, and /n/ have soft correlates at all.
• The consonant /x/ is lost everywhere, though it is replaced by /j/ when it occurs after /e/, and by /v/ when it occurs after /u/.
            Examples: rèko (R1: 18), zavanùla (S3: 51);  drèju (R3: 24), dùva (R3:30)
• The consonant /f / is always replaced by /v/.
            Example: vamìlija (R1: 11)
    In fact /f/ does not occur even as the voiceless allophone of /v/.
            Example: òvce (R1: 80)
• Intervocalic /j/ is replaced by /v/ after /o/.
            Example: stovà (S2: 16)
• The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ in word-initial position, and to /vn/ in other positions.
            Examples: mlògo (R1: 42), opòvnu (V3: 25)
• Before a vowel, the sequence /jk/ is replaced by /k’/.
            Example: devòk’u (V3: 13)
 
Accent
• The accent in monosyllabic masculine nouns hardly ever shifts to the definite article.
            Example: dɤ̀nɤt (R2: 13)
• The accent in the non-nominative form of disyllabic feminine nouns is shifted from the ending to the root syllable.
            Example: gòru (S1: 60)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in L-participles, regardless of whether there is a syllabic prefix or not.
            Examples: čuvàl (R1: 42), doodìli (R2: 26).
    The same advancement occurs in aorist forms, except that the accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 2nd and 3rd singular forms. Examples:
            1st singular aorist    ukačì (R1: 6)
            2nd singular aorist   pràti (S2: 21)
            3rd singular aorist   kìmnu (R1: 5), prèmi (R1: 49)
• The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many second conjugation verbs.
            Example: svàri (R1: 83)
• The accent is frequently advanced to the ending in polysyllabic masculine nouns.
            Example: ovčarè (S4: 9)
• In some adjectives the stress is on the ending.
            Example: golemà (R1: 14)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for both masculine and feminine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ovčarè (S4: 9), livàdete (R1: 97)
• Plural forms of both adjectives and L-participles distinguish feminine from masculine gender.
            Examples: stàrete (R3: 14), vadìle (R3: 15)
 • Non-nominative forms of feminine nouns, feminine singular adjectives, and masculine nouns signifying animate beings, are in regular use.
            Examples: cṛ̀kvu (R2: 6), cèlu (S3: 28), volà (R1: 41)
        These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, such nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven): the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case (“animate accusative” in the  instance of the masculine nouns) and was used for all other meanings
• A particularly interesting corollary of the above is the fact that the definite article attached to these forms also shows inherited cases endings (/-tu/ for feminine and /-toga/ for animate masculine).  
            Example: livàdutu (R1: 4), kon’àtoga (V1: 45)
• The masculine singular definite article ends in the consonant /-t/.
            Example: vòlɤt (R1: 15)
• The forms of personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative  jà (R1: 4)
            3rd singular nominative   òn (R1: 5),  onà (R1: 16), onò (R2: 34)
            3rd singular feminine accusative short form  g’u (R2: 63)
            1st plural nominative  mì (R1: 20)
            3rd plural nominative onì (not attested in these texts)
            3rd plural accusative  n’ì  (R2: 19)
            3rd plural dative  n’ìm (R2: 19)
• The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-ov-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Example: ovàj (R4: 6)
• The ending in all 1st person singular present tense forms is /-m/.
            Example: pasèm (R1: 4)
•  The ending in all 1st person plural tense forms (present, aorist and imperfect) is /-mo/.   Examples: ìdemo (R1: 20), oràmo (V2: 1) // manùmo (R2 116) // òdejmo (S4: 43)
• The 3rd plural ending of the present tense lacks the final /-t/ present in most other Bulgarian dialects. For more commentary on 3rd plural present forms, see the final section.
            Example: živèju (R1: 51)
• The 3rd plural ending of the aorist tense is /-še/; the ending /-u/ also appears in Vŭrbovo.
            Examples: razvalìše (R2: 8), izèdou (V2: 51)
• The suffix /-na/ is normally dropped from aorist and L-participle forms, though some verbs allow variation.
            Examples: sèdo (S1: 37), pàdla (R4: 13) // svikɤl (S2: 37), sviknùli (S2: 38)
• The stem of the imperfect forms contains the extender morpheme /-še-/.
            Example: ìmašemo (R1: 3)
• All passive participles are formed with the suffix /-n/.
            Example: svìena (R2: 30)
• Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example:  tùpan’e (R3: 21)
• The future particle is če, frequently followed by the conjunction da.
            Example: če da putùe (S1: 32)
 
NON-CONGRUENCE between dialects
    The only significant difference between the three villages represented here concerns the endings of the 3rd person plural present tense forms. In Repljana and Stakevci, second conjugation verbs take the ending /-e/, whereas in Vŭrbovo they take the ending /-u/.
            Examples:  ulòve (R1: 113), nadùpče (S4: 47) // sètu (V3: 28)
    In addition, there is a vowel contraction in the ending of third conjugation verbs in Repljana and Stakevci, but no such contraction in Vŭrbovo.
            Examples: iskàru (R1: 96), dùmu (S4: 18) // sàkaju (V3: 13)

"Vŭrbovo","11","Belogradčik","TRANSITIONAL: Belogradčik
The dialect of Belogradčik is located in the far northwest near the border with Serbia and is represented on the website by the villages Repljana (R), Stakevci (S), and Vŭrbovo (V). Together with the Trŭn dialect, it is part of larger group of dialects which share traits with the neighboring far eastern Serbian dialects. For this reason, the dialects in the larger group are sometimes called “transitional dialects” or “border dialects”.

Phonology.
The historical Slavic vowel “jat” always appears as /e/.
            Examples: valèlo (R1: 67), lèp (R1: 87)
 
The historical sequence “ja” (including the sequence “post-alveolar + a”) is preserved with very few exceptions.
            jàgn’e (R 2: 7),  običàli (R2: 87) // čèkaj (R2: 100), jèdene (R1: 88)
 
The historical Slavic “back nasal” always appears as /u/.
            Examples: pùt (R1: 20), bùdu (R3: 2)
 
The historical Slavic “front nasal” always appears as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants. Thus, the historical phenomenon known as “mixing of the nasals” does not occur here.
            Example: često (V3: 1)
 
The historical Slavic “back jer” appears as /ɤ/, as in many other Bulgarian dialects. It is only in the “transitional” dialects, however, that the historical Slavic “front jer” also appears always as /ɤ/.
            Examples: dɤ̀n (R1: 29), venɤ̀cɤt (R4: 40)
 
The early South Slavic syllabic liquids remain unchanged.
            Examples: kṛ̀v (R1: 23), skḷ̀če (R1: 42), vḷ̀nu (R3: 4)
 
The Proto-Slavic sequences /*tj/ and /*dj/ appear as /č/ and /dž/, respectively.
            Examples: pràčam (R1: 43), razgledžuvà (S1: 49)
 
The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/ + front jer” appears as /cṛ/.
	Example: cṛvèni (R2: 40)
 
Early South Slavic “epenthetic /l/” is not lost, as it is in most other Bulgarian dialects.
            Example: zeml’ùtu (V1: 34)
 
Soft consonants occur rarely, and never in masculine definite forms or in verbal endings (contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects).
            Examples: dɤ̀nɤt (R2: 13), bolù (R1: 103), opòvnu (V3: 23)
     In fact, only /k/, /g/, /l/, and /n/ have soft correlates at all.
 
The consonant /x/ is lost everywhere, though it is replaced by /j/ when it occurs after /e/, and by /v/ when it occurs after /u/.
            Examples: rèko (R1: 18), zavanùla (S3: 51);  drèju (R3: 24), dùva (R3:30)
 
The consonant f is always replaced by v.
            Example: vamìlija (R1: 11)
    In fact f does not occur even as the voiceless allophone of /v/.
            Example: òvce (R1: 80)
 
Intervocalic /j/ is replaced by /v/ after /o/.
            Example: stovà (S2: 16)
 
The sequence /mn/ is dissimilated to /ml/ in word-initial position, and to /vn/ in other positions.
            Examples: mlògo (R1: 42), opòvnu (V3: 25)
 
Before a vowel, the sequence /jk/ is replaced by /k’/.
            Example: devòk’u (V3: 13)
 
Accent
The accent in monosyllabic masculine nouns hardly ever shifts to the definite article.
            Example: dɤ̀nɤt (R2: 13)
 
The accent in the non-nominative form of disyllabic feminine nouns is shifted from the ending to the root syllable.
            Example: gòru (S1: 60)
 
The accent advances to the theme vowel in L-participles, regardless of whether there is a syllabic prefix or not.
            Examples: čuvàl (R1: 42), doodìli (R2: 26).
    The same advancement occurs in aorist forms, except that the accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 2nd and 3rd singular forms. Examples:
            1st singular aorist    ukačì (R1: 6)
            2nd singular aorist   pràti (S2: 21)
            3rd singular aorist   kìmnu (R1: 5), prèmi (R1: 49)
 
The accent is retracted from the theme vowel in the present of many second conjugation verbs.
            Example: svàri (R1: 83)
 
The accent is frequently advanced to the ending in polysyllabic masculine nouns.
            Example: ovčarè (S4: 9)
 
In some adjectives the stress is on the ending.
            Example: golemà (R1: 14)
 
Morphology
The plural ending for both masculine and feminine nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: ovčarè (S4: 9), livàdete (R1: 97)
 
Plural forms of both adjectives and L-participles distinguish feminine from masculine gender.
            Examples: stàrete (R3: 14), vadìle (R3: 15)
 
Non-nominative forms of feminine nouns, feminine singular adjectives, and masculine nouns signifying animate beings, are in regular use.
            Examples: cṛ̀kvu (R2: 6), cèlu (S3: 28), volà (R1: 41)
        These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, such nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven): the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case (“animate accusative” in the  instance of the masculine nouns) and was used for all other meanings
 
A particularly interesting corollary of the above is the fact that the definite article attached to these forms also shows inherited cases endings (/-tu/ for feminine and /-toga/ for animate masculine).
            Example: livàdutu (R1: 4), kon’àtoga (V1: 45)
 
The masculine singular definite article ends in the consonant /-t/.
            Example: vòlɤt (R1: 15)
 
The forms of personal pronouns are different. Examples:
            1st singular nominative  jà (R1: 4)
            3rd singular nominative   òn (R1: 5),  onà (R1: 16), onò (R2: 34)
            3rd singular feminine accusative short form  g’u (R2: 63)
            1st plural nominative  mì (R1: 20)
            3rd plural nominative onì (not attested in these texts)
            3rd plural accusative  n’ì  (R2: 19)
            3rd plural dative  n’ìm (R2: 19)
 
The demonstrative pronouns distinguish a third degree of deixis, marking the idea “near” with the formant /-ov-/, in addition to the expected “neutral” and “distant”, marked with the formants /-t-/ and /-on-/, respectively.
            Example: ovàj (R4: 6)
 
The ending in all 1st person singular present tense forms is /-m/.
            Example: pasèm (R1: 4)
 
The ending in all 1st person plural tense forms (present, aorist and imperfect) is /-mo/. Examples: ìdemo (R1: 20), oràmo (V2: 1) // manùmo (R2 116) // òdejmo (S4: 43)
 
The 3rd plural ending of the present tense lacks the final /-t/ present in most other Bulgarian dialects. For more commentary on 3rd plural present forms, see the final section.
            Example: živèju (R1: 51)
 
The 3rd plural ending of the aorist tense is /-še/; the ending /-u/ also appears in Vŭrbovo.
            Examples: razvalìše (R2: 8), izèdou (V2: 51)
 
The suffix /-na/ is normally dropped from aorist and L-participle forms, though some verbs allow variation.
            Examples: sèdo (S1: 37), pàdla (R4: 13) // svikɤl (S2: 37), sviknùli (S2: 38)
 
The stem of the imperfect forms contains the extender morpheme /-še-/.
            Example: ìmašemo (R1: 3)
 
All passive participles are formed with the suffix /-n/.
            Example: svìena (R2: 30)
 
Verbal nouns end in /-n’e/.
            Example:  tùpan’e (R3: 21)
 
The future particle is če, frequently followed by da
            Example: če da putùe (S1: 32)
 
NON-CONGRUENCE between dialects
    The only significant difference between the three villages represented here concerns the endings of the 3rd person plural present tense forms. In Repljana and Stakevci, second conjugation verbs take the ending /-e/, whereas in Vŭrbovo they take the ending /-u/.
            Examples:  ulòve (R1: 113), nadùpče (S4: 47) // sètu (V3: 28)
 
    In addition, there is a vowel contraction in the ending of third conjugation verbs in Repljana and Stakevci, but no such contraction in Vŭrbovo.
            Examples: iskàru (R1: 96), dùmu (S4: 18) // sàkaju (V3: 13)

            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. According to Miletič’s definition, the Moesian group extends to the river Jantra in the west, and in the past even as far west as the “jat”-boundary, the basic division line between western and eastern macro-dialects (Miletich 1903). There are several sub-dialects within the Moesian group that form relatively small islands, but most of the territory is unspecified, simply called Moesian (see the IBL dialect map at http://ibl.bas.bg//bulgarian_dialects/). Although there is no single unifying feature, but rather characteristic Moesian traits that overlap from region to region but do not cover the whole area, the speech of the area is immediately recognizable as Moesian.
            Three of the four recognizable islands within Moesian are represented on this website: the two villages Garvan (G) and Srebŭrna (S) represent the Greben variety; the village Petrov Dol (PD) represents the Sŭrt variety, and the village Drjanovec (D) represents the Kapan variety. The list below summarizes the salient features of these Moesian sub-varieties. It is based on the speech of these four villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. S1 = Srebŭrna 1, PD2 = Petrov Dol 2), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /’a/ in position before hard syllables. There is regional difference in its behavior before soft syllables: it is /’ɛ/ in Sŭrt (PD), and /’e/ elsewhere.
            Examples: m’àstu (PD1: 99), kul’àntȕ (D1: 25), l’àtu (G2: 24), ml’aku (S2: 30) // nid’èl’e (S1: 104), b’èli (G1: 48), gul’èmi (D1: 63) // nɤm’ɛ̀ri (PD1: 33)
    The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”.
            Examples: venčàvə (G1: 59), isušàvəš (S2: 55) // čeršèvi (S1: 107), venč’èni (G1: 70) // mɤlčàna (PD2: 18), vɤrš’ɛ̀čki (PD3: 115)
• The historical Slavic vowels “back jer” and “back nasal” appear in stressed root syllables as /ɤ/ (see under Morphology for the particular behavior of “back jer” in the masculine singular definite article).
            Examples of back jer: tɤ̀kɤn (D1: 17), dɤ̀ski (G1: 123), mɤ̀kniš (PD3: 49)
            Examples of back nasal: mɤ̀kɤtɤ (D2: 69), pɤ̀t’ (G2: 17, PD1: 37), bɤ̀di (S1: 55)
     Miletič considered the “strongly dark” pronunciation of this vowel, which became known as “velar ъ”, to be one of the principal features of Moesian dialects. This feature is very rare today. Extensive fieldwork underlying the Bulgarian Dialect Atlas (undertaken in the 1950s) found it in only one location, Petrov Dol. In texts recorded for BDLT, it exists as the optional allophonic raising of /ɤ/ to /ɯ/.
            Examples: kɯ̀šti (PD2: 75); rəskɤ̀səli (PD1: 91)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front jer” appears in stressed root syllables as either /e/ or /ɤ/, with only the latter occurring before nasal consonants.
            Examples: dèn’ (D1; 60), l’èku (S2: 39), ž’ènim (PD: 86) // pɤ̀sro (G1: 48), zɤ̀mniš (D2: 52), zɤ̀mət (S1: 56)
• The historical Slavic vowel “front nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /e/, including after post-alveolar consonants (thus, there is no “mixing of the nasals”).
            Examples: gl’èdə (D2: 22), zèt’u (S1: 94), šètə (D1: 42), ž’ètvəta (PD: 7)
• All unstressed non-high vowels are replaced by the corresponding high vowels. Thus, unstressed /e/, /o/, and /a/ are replaced by /i/, /u/, and /ɤ/, respectively. In Bulgarian dialectology this is termed “full vowel reduction”.
            Examples: b’èši (D1: 8), vrèmi (G1: 21) usimnàjsi (D1: 44) //  udòlu (G1: 21), udr’èž’im (PD3: 7) // glɤvɤ̀tɤ (D2: 11), klɤnn’ì (PD3: 33)
     In posttonic syllables and especially before sonorants, unstressed /e/ is pronounced as /’ə/ or /’ɤ/.
            Examples: v’èč’ər (D2: 21) bosìl’ək (S1: 93), v’ès’ɤlu (D1: 8), tòpč’ənca (PD2: 34)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /’u/ or /y/ before labial consonants. This is one of the highly distinctive markers of Moesian speech.
            Examples: ž’uwòt (D1: 74) ut’ùəm (PD1: 97), ž’uv’ɛ̀i (PD1: 20), b’ùwa (S1: 105), zəl’ùwəm (S1: 120)
• Word-initial stressed /o/ is replaced by /wo/.
            Examples: wòc’əm (D1: 23), wòs’əm (G1: 189)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost. Continuants in position before such a lost vowel are frequently lengthened; this process, called here “consonant-vowel fusion” here, is especially common after sonorants.
            Examples: čètri (D1: 11), žìttu (PD3: 147), sìttu (G1: 179) // məgàr:tȁ (D2: 39), màs:tȅ (G1: 116), dàr:tu (S1: 106)
• The consonant /x/ is lost in word-initial position; in other positions of the word it is replaced by /w/, /v/, or /f/. This is another of the highly distinctive markers of Moesian speech.
            Examples: òd’ɤ (D1: 40), òrtə (S2: 155) // t’aw (G1: 96), màwnɤ (D2: 46), b’àw (D1: 23), zèw (S2: 119) // òrevi (S2: 8), tùrivə (D2: 65), tɤ̀rsiva (G1: 168), slàgəvmi (PD2: 45) // nəm’èr’uf (S1: 34), kòžufč’etu (G1: 7).
            Exception:  snɤɤ̀ (D2: 33)
• The consonant /f/ is replaced by /v/ or /w/. Before the vowel /u/ it sometimes shifts to the bilabial voiceless fricative  /ф/.
            Examples: čəršèvi (S1: 107) // suwrɤ̀tə (S1: 97) // фùsti (G1: 213)
• The consonant /v/ is lost before rounded vowels, and usually replaced by /w/ in other positions (/w/ can also appear before rounded vowels, thought this is more rare).
            Examples: pruòdijmi (D2: 41), tòjtə (D1: 53), otòr:no (G2: 10), utòrenə (PD1: 99) // òwču (D1: 61), nìwɤtɤ (D2: 22), wrɤ̀štət (G1: 157), wèče (PD1: 54) // ž’uwòt (D1: 74)
• Soft consonants can appear word-finally.
            Examples: dèn’ (D1: 60), p’èt’ (D1: 65), pɤ̀t’ (G2: 17), d’èsit’ (PD2: 22)
• The sequence /dn/ is assimilated to /nn/.
            Examples: innà (D1: 59), plànne (G1: 145), klɤnn’ì (PD3: 33)
• The vowel /i/ is sometimes inserted before an initial consonant cluster.
            Examples: ismɤ̀kvə (G1: 68), iskɤ̀swə (S2: 51)
• There is a regional difference in the behavior of the sequence /str/: it is replaced by /sr/ in Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D) varieties but not in Sŭrt (PD).
            Examples: srùvɤ (D1: 124), sràf (G2: 29), srigɤ̀t (S2: 2) // strɤ̀ka (PD 2: 24)
 
Accent
• The accent is retracted in the plural form of disyllabic feminine nouns.
            Examples: dɤ̀ski (G1: 123), sèstri (S1: 76), glàvi (S2: 130)
• There is frequent occurence of a secondary stress on the plural definite article; this also occurs, though less frequently, on feminine and neuter singular articles.
            Examples: màjki̥t’ȅ (D2: 16), pìtkit’ȅ (PD2: 34), drùgit’ȅ (G1: 173) // kul’àntȕ (D1: 25), rìz:tȁ (G1: 173)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for polysyllabic nouns is /-e/, though /i/ appears as well.
            Examples: əjdučòre (G2: 28), misàl’e (PD2: 89), rəkòe (PD3: 48), kumšìe (D2: 20) // məsùri (S2: 124), svədbàri (S1: 67)
• There is regional difference with respect to the ending of feminine nouns when stressed. In Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D), it is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely /ɤ/, whereas in Sǔrt (PD), it is /a/.
            Examples: glɤvɤ̀tə (D2: 11), rɤkɤ̀ (G1: 69), strənɤ̀ (S2: 143)// guràta (PD1: 24), vudà (PD2: 19)
               These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. In the Greben and Kapan groups, it was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns, while in the Sŭrt group it was the old nominative case in /a/  which continued as their single form.  
• There is regional difference in the form of the definite article for masculine singular nouns.  In Greben (G), (S) and Kapan (D), it is /-o/ (when unstressed, /-u/), but in Sǔrt (PD) it is /-ɤ/.
            Examples: məžò (G1: 5), zèt’u (S1: 67), dulàpu (D1: 17), tòju (G1: 60) // pragɤ̀ (PD1: 31), zbòrɤ (PD2: 123), trètijɤ (PD1: 71)
• Some indefinite adjectives appear in the long form.
            Examples: drùgij (D1: 49), nàšij (D1: 71), šèstij (PD2: 5)
• Personal pronouns are used as demonstrative.
            Examples: n’ègu dèn’ (D1: 60), nègu bòp (S2: 181), t’àw xòra (D1: 20), tè misàl’e (PD: 89)
• There is regional difference in the form of the back nasal in 1st singular and 3rd plural present tense endings of the 2nd conjugation. In Kapan (D) it is the expected /ɤ/; in Greben (S) it is either a fronted version of this, or the middle fronted vowel /e/; while in Sŭrt (PD) it appears as the high front vowel /i/.
            Examples: dujɤ̀t (D2: 39) // izgud’ə̝̀t (S1: 51), dər’èt (S1: 78) // kreštìt (PD3: 135), vɤr’ìt (PD3: 43)
• The early Slavic “inserted jer” is preserved in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Example: dunèsələ (G1: 188)
• The preposition v ‘in’ appears in the form u.
            Examples: u tòs mom’ènt (D1: 28), u dàmu (G1: 109), u kɤ̀šti (PD2: 74)

               The larger Rupic dialect group covers most of the south of Bulgaria, and the westernmost portion of Rupic includes a number of quite distinct dialect groups, among which is the Razlog-Babjak dialect, which is represented on the BDLT site by two villages, Babjak (Bb) and Dolno Draglište (DD), and the town of Bansko (Bn). 
               Stojkov called Babjak and Razlog two different dialects, providing a separate list of features for each one, but there is considerable overlapping between the two lists (Stojkov 1993: 141-142). Furthermore, a perusal of all 314 maps of the Bulgarian Dialect Atlas, v. 3, yields only minor accentual and morphological differences, plus the fact of a greater degree of vowel reduction in Babjak. We do not consider these differences sufficient to separate the two, and call this dialect rather the Razlog-Babjak dialect. Although the name Razlog covers the region as a whole, the qualifier Babjak is added because the term “Babjak dialect” is a known label within the discipline of Bulgarian dialectology. 
               This is one of the areas in Bulgaria where the local dialect is in very active use, and it is not uncommon to hear from the local educated people a speech variety that differs from the traditional dialect only in the use of learned words. Of course, this is not to say that they do not also have full and active command of the standard language.
            The list below summarizes the salient features of the Razlog-Babjak dialect. It is based on the speech of the three locations mentioned above as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the location, as noted above (Bn = Bansko); the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. Bb1 = Babjak 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
 
Phonology
• The historical Slavic vowel “jat” appears in stressed syllables as /ɛ/,  though in Dolno Draglište it appears by far more frequently as /e/. 
               Examples: rɛ̀žət  (Bb1: 32), bɛ̀lo  (Bn: 8), pɛ̀eme  (DD1: 35) // vrème (DD2: 3), bèga:  (DD1: 36).
     The difference between Dolno Draglište and the other two locations with respect to this vowel is not so great as it appears. It would be a significant difference if the result of “jat” had merged with the result of etymological /e/,  as it does in nearly all western Bulgarian dialects. But in fact the two remain distinct: the latter vowel was raised to /e̝/  and the opposition was preserved (a phonetic change known as a “chain shift”).
               Examples of raised /e/:  pè̝pel’  (DD1: 22), nè̝gu  (DD1: 22)
• The historical Slavic vowel “ back nasal” appears in stressed syllables as /a/.
               Examples: màže  (Bb2: 8), skàpu  (Bn: 230), sàduvèto  (DD1: 14)
     Note: Contrary to most other Bulgarian dialects, the sequence of /r/ + “back nasal” did not merge with early South Slavic syllabic /ṛ/.
               Examples: kràk  (Bn: 9), tràsa:  (Bb1: 30)
• The historical Slavic vowel “back jer” appears in root vowels as /a/  or /o/,  but only as /o/  in affixes and in the definite article.
               Examples for back jer in root: màx  (Bn: 302), zəlàže  (DD1: 34); tòkmu  (Bn: 168)
               Examples for back jer in affix: sošìeni  (Bn: 302), soberè̝m  (DD3: 34)
               Examples for back jer in article: kràgu  (Bn: 8), lèbu  (DD3: 18)
• The early South Slavic syllabic liquids /ṛ/  and /ḷ/  appear as /rɤ/  and /ɤ/  respectively.
               Example: vrɤšème  (Bb2: 9), brɤ̀kame  (DD3: 24), vrɤvì  (DD1: 5) // vɤ̀na  (Bn: 273), napɤ̀ni  (Bn: 154)
     Note: In Bansko there are also numerous instances of the sequence /ɤr/.
            Examples: kɤ̀rvavìci  (Bn: 183), bɤ̀rdu  (Bn: 269)
• The early South Slavic sequence “/čr/  + front jer” appears as /cɤr/.
            Examples: cɤ̀rva:  (Bn: 152), cɤ̀rni  (Bn: 268), iscɤ̀rvi  (DD3: 40)
• The consonant /x/ is lost in most positions. After the vowel /u/ it is replaced by /v/  and in past tense verbal endings it is either lost, or replaced by /j/. 
            Examples: lɛ̀p (Bb2: 18), òdim (Bn: 296), òru (DD2: 3) // dùvə  (Bb2: 13), pùvə  (DD1: 23) // ìdea (DD1: 13), rèkua (Bn: 232) // rànəjə (Bb1: 28), bɛ̀jme (Bn: 236),  kazàj (Bn: 209), òdejme (DD2: 10)
      In Babjak only, /x/ is replaced by /h/ (the laryngeal fricative) before consonants in verbal endings.
            Examples: jədɛ̀hme  (Bb2: 15), mèlehme  (Bb2: 19)
• The loss of /x/  before a consonant is compensated for by lengthening of the preceding vowel.
            Examples: kòle:me  (Bn: 217), pečè:me  (DD3: 5)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: žìttò  (Bb2: 10), kùpme  (Bn: 273), raptìlo  (DD2: 3)
• The initial sequence /mn/  is dissimilated to /fn/.    
            Example: fnògu  (Bn: 87)
• The sequence /sr/  is replaced by /str/.
            Examples: stredàtə  (Bb1: 5), stredàta  (Bn: 124)
• Soft /k’/  and /g’/  are replaced by soft /č’/  and /ž’/.
            Examples: č’ùpu  (Bb3: 25), č’ìsalu  (Bn: 87), sedènč’i  (DD1: 33), č’èrž’i  (Bn: 265)    
• Soft consonants can appear in word-final position.
            Examples: sòl’  (Bb1: 8), čekàn’  (Bn: 85), pè̝pel’  (DD1: 23)
 
Accent
• There is frequent occurence of double accent.
            Examples: pruvìncijàtə  (Bb4: 4), bànicìte  (Bn: 16), nèkugàš  (DD3: 10)
• The accent is retracted in many disyllabic feminine and neuter nouns.
            Examples: vòda  (Bn: 157), žèni  (Bb2: 8), kòri  (Bn: 57); bràšno  (Bn: 5), mèsu  (Bn: 92), òru  (DD2: 13), jàjca  (Bn: 6), dèca  (DD1: 9)
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in 1st person singular present tense.
            Example: nàsnuva  (Bn: 10), pèkɤ  (DD3: 3)
• The accent advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and participles, including those with a syllabic prefix.
            Examples: kažàj  (Bn: 209), stənà  (Bb4: 28), gledàli  (DD1: 21)   upravìl  (Bn: 238), iskisnàl  (Bb1: 13),             
• The accent is retracted to the initial syllable in imperative forms.
            Examples: kàži  (Bn: 238), pòčini  (Bn: 231)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending of masculine  nouns is /-e/.
            Examples: snòpe  (Bb2: 7), ergène  (DD1: 32)
• The definite article for masculine singular nouns is /-o/ (unstressed /-u/) after a hard consonant, and /-e/ after a soft consonant.
            Examples: mažò  (Bn: 202), lèbu  (DD3: 18); razbòe  (Bn: 277)
• The definite article for masculine plural nouns is /-to/.
            Examples: rəsnàčetu  (Bn: 301), sàduvèto  (DD1: 14), ergènetò  (Bb3: 18)
• The verbal ending for 3rd person plural present tense is /-a/,  which is lengthened when unstressed.  
            Example: nəkovà  (Bb2: 27), jədà  (Bn: 14), suberà  (DD1: 17) // nəčùka:  (Bb2: 27), rèda:  (Bn: 163), bèga:  (DD1: 36)
• The future particle is k’e or č’e (č’ in prevocalic position).
            Examples: k’e sìpe  (Bb1: 7), č’e pumìneš  (Bb4: 26), č’e kažùvam  (Bn: 89) // č’ ìde         (DD1: 15)
• The present stem is used in aorist forms and L-participles in some verb classes.
            Examples kažàj  (Bn: 209)
• The perfective is stem is used to form secondary imperfectives.
            Examples: kažùvam  (Bn: 89), razrɛ̀žuva  (Bn: 188)
• Passive participles are formed with the suffix /-n/.
            Examples: izmìeni  (Bn: 181), sošìeni  (Bn: 302)

"Kolju Marinovo","2","Čirpan","NORTHEASTERN: Sub-Balkan
            The large northeastern region comprises two large dialect groupings, Moesian and Balkan, which share a number of features, yet they are distinct enough to be considered separately, with each divided into clear sub-groups. Within the Balkan group, the sub-Balkan variety is represented on the website by two villages from the region of Čirpan, Kolju Marinovo (KM), Markovo (M); and one from the region of Stara Zagora, Iskrica (Is). The sub-Balkan dialect group is defined by a complex of features, some of which are shared with Rupic dialects and some of which are specific to the sub-Balkan group. The features illustrated below are characteristic of the sub-Balkan group, dialect, though one of its most salient features (the stressed ending /-a/ in 1st singular present tense forms) is found in only one of the villages represented here.
            The list below summarizes the most important features of the sub-Balkan dialect. It is based on the speech of these three villages as represented by texts on the site, with examples taken from those texts.
            Abbreviations: the capital letter refers to the village, as noted above; the letter represents the village (e.g. M = Markovo) and the following number identifies the text from that village (e.g. KM1 = Kolju Marinovo 1), and the number after the colon identifies the line within the text where the cited form occurs.
Phonology
• The results for the historical sequences “ja” and “post-alveolar + a” are the same everywhere as those for “jat”, namely /a/ in position before hard syllables and /e/ in position before soft syllables.
            Examples: čàkəj (KM4: 66), čàsə (KM5: 30) // jègne (KM5: 2)
• In most sub-Balkan dialects, the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal” appears as /a/ in word-final position and /ɤ/ elsewhere (except in definite forms of feminine nouns in a consonant, where it is always stressed /ɤ/). In texts on this site, this general feature, /a/ in word-final position, occurs only in Iskrica; it is absent Koljo Marinovo and Markovo.      
            Examples from Iskrica: sɤ̀butə (Is1: 49), idɤ̀t (Is1: 36), mumɤ̀tə (Is1: 24), vičirtɤ̀ (Is3: 61) // ležà (Is1: 4), nəsəd’à (Is2: 21) rəkà (Is2: 16) // kɤ̀štə (M4: 40), vudɤ̀ (KM5: 43), kačɤ̀ (KM4: 75).        
• There is full vowel reduction: all unstressed non-high vowels are replaced by the corresponding high vowels. Thus, unstressed /e/, /o/, and /a/ are replaced by /i/, /u/, and /ə/, respectively.
            Examples: vr’èmi (M: 5), pičèm (KM1: 15), pribìrəmi (KM1: 8), ditè (Is1: 15) // d’àdu (M: 7), vulòvi (KM1: 73), pus’ègnə (Is1: 3) // kvəsnìk (KM1: 17), nəsəd’à (Is2: 21).
• Before or after sonorants, /e/ and /i/ are replaced by /’ə/, almost exclusively in post-tonic syllables.
            Examples: mèn’ə (M: 37), vèč’ər (Is1: 75), vr’ətènu (Is1: 69) // užèn’əh (Is1: 1), kùp’əl (M: 10).
• Unstressed /e/ and /i/ are replaced by /u/ after post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: čušmɤ̀ (KM5: 40), žulezà (KM4: 6), žuv’èjət (M: 145)
• The vowel /i/ is replaced by /u/ before labial consonants in stressed syllables; this occurs only in Iskrica.
            Example: ot’ùvəme (Is1: 71)
• Unstressed vowels are frequently lost.
            Examples: bəkɤ̀rti (KM6: 43), fcèti (M: 40), grədìntə (M: 27), jergènti (M: 89), bàncətə (Is1: 2), sèltu (Is1: 27)
• The consonant /j/ is inserted before initial /e/.
            Examples: jèsenno (KM6: 3), jergènti (M: 89),  jeno-(Is2: 1)
• The consonant /x/ behaves differently depending on its place in the word. In initial position or between vowels, it is lost altogether, in all three villages. In medial position before a consonant it is replaced by /j/ in Markovo and Kolju Marinovo, but lost in Iskrica (frequently with compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel). In final position it is either preserved or replaced by /h/  in Koljo Marinovo and Markovo, but replaced by /h/ or /w/ in Iskrica .
            Examples of initial position: òdili (KM3: 35), l’àb (Is3: 25)
            Examples of medial position: dokàrvəə (KM3: 70), ràdvəə (Is1: 9) // isɤ̀jnaa (KM5: 11), ìməjmi (KM5: 42) // zè:me (Is2: 26), prɤ̀ska:mi (Is2: 15), b’àme (Is1: 16)
            Examples of final position:  zər’àzəx (KM5: 11), nəpràvih (M: 39), t’ah (M: 174) // zəbràiw (Is1: 50), zəvɤ̀ršiw (Is3: 16)
• The consonants /l/ and /n/ are softened before soft and post-alveolar consonants.
            Examples: gədùl’ki (KM6: 28), mənìn’ki (KM6: 57), mɤl’čɤ̀t (M: 192), nəžil’t’àvə (Is2: 35), t’àn’te (Is2: 3)
• The sequences /dn/ and sometimes also /tn/, and /bn/ are assimilated to /nn/ and /mn/, respectively.
            Examples: plànne (KM5: 44), pannà (M:37), ennà (Is1: 68); s’ènne (I1: 13) // srɤ̀mnəl (M: 130)
• Fricative consonants are replaced by affricates after /r/.
            Examples: vɤ̀rdzənə (KM6: 8), dərdžàə (M:50), dərdžàl (KM5: 30), svɤ̀rdzənu (Is1: 63)
 
Accent
• There is occasional occurrence of double accent.
            Examples: šìlencàtə (KM3: 1), zɤ̀pčetàtə (KM4: 77), àgneàta (Is3: 8)
• The accent is retracted in the plural of feminine nouns, and sometimes also in the singular.
            Examples: dɤ̀ski (KM3: 64), sèstri (M: 72) // rɤ̀kə (KM6: 31) // dəskɤ̀tə (KM3: 71)
• The accent sometimes advances to the theme vowel in aorist forms and L-participles.
            Examples: stanà (KM5: 9), pannà (M: 37), ustanà (M: 129), kəzàl (M: 17), ustanàli (M: 13), stənà: (Is1: 21)
 
Morphology
• The plural ending for polysyllabic masculine nouns is /-e/, though /i/ appears as well.
            Examples: kəràre (KM3: 25), ərmàne (KM2: 70); čekɤ̀mi (KM2: 61), krèmeni (KM3: 57)
• The ending of feminine nouns when stress is the same as the result of the historical Slavic “back nasal”, namely/ɤ/, except in the non-definite form in Iskrica.
            Examples: rikɤ̀tə (KM5: 63), vujnɤ̀tɤ̥ (M: 13), mumɤ̀tə (Is1: 24) // veselbà (Is1: 63)
    These forms represent an interesting result in the history of Bulgarian, which gradually lost all case endings in nouns. At the penultimate stage of this development, feminine nouns had only two case endings (instead of the inherited seven), the nominative case and the so-called casus generalis, which continued the form of the accusative case – which ended in the historical Slavic vowel “back nasal”, and was used for all other meanings. It was this casus generalis that was adopted as the single form of feminine nouns.
• There are different forms of the personal pronouns, including differences between the three villages. Examples:
            3rd singular accusative feminine short form: gə in Markovo and Iskrica // jə in Koljo Marinovo
           Examples: žə jə nəmùšiš (KM2: 16), up’èkələ gə (Is1: 2) // nìj gə pràimi (M: 4) 
            3rd plural nominative: tìj (KM4: 8, M: 10), tìjə (KM3: 43), t’èe (Is1: 9)
• The aorist theme vowel /o/ is replaced by /a/ (pronounced /ə/ when unstressed).
            Examples: dàdəh (M: 36), prudàdəjmi (M: 40), dòjdah (Is1: 1)
• The future particle is že.
            Examples: že izl’èzim (M: 89), že tùriš (KM2: 9),  že dòət (Is3: 42)
• Early Slavic “inserted jer” is retained in the inflected forms of L-participles.
            Examples: obl’akələ (S4: 25), p’èkəli (V1: 111), up’èkələ (Is1: 2)
 
SPECIFIC FEATURES
The dialect of Iskrica, which is very close to the Rupic area, has some additional features considered predominantly Rupic:
• Under stress he historical Slavic vowel “jat” frequently appears as /’a/ or /ɛ/ before a soft consonant or front vowel.
            Examples: t’àn’te (Is2: 29), n’àštu (Is3: 17), gul’ɛ̀mi (Is 2: 1) // b’èše (Is1: 1)
• The nominative pronoun for 1st person singular is /ja/.
            Example: jà sɤzdàdəw (Is1: 17)
• The perfective stem is used in the secondary imperfectives of some verbs.
            Examples: nər’àdəme  (Is2: 40), zəfàt’ət  (Is1: 59)
